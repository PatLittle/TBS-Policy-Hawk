This report compares two versions of the Directive on Automated Decision-Making (document ID: 32592, version ID: 4). The older version is dated April 25, 2023, and the newer version is dated June 24, 2025. Despite both files having the same version ID, the date in the file names suggests a content update, with the 2025 version being the most recent. The analysis is based on the provided XML snippets, which are incomplete and contain ellipses. As such, this summary focuses on the visible differences, emphasizing changes in effective date provisions and risk assessment tables. For a policy wonk audience, the summary highlights key governance, compliance, and risk management updates.

## Executive Summary

The updates to the Directive on Automated Decision-Making between the April 25, 2023, and June 24, 2025, versions reflect enhancements in regulatory clarity and risk governance for automated decision systems. Key changes include the addition of a grandfather clause for legacy systems in the effective date section, addressing systems developed before June 24, 2025, to ease transition compliance. Furthermore, the risk assessment table has been expanded and refined, with updates to approval authorities, human involvement requirements, and section references. These modifications strengthen human oversight, align approval processes with higher governance levels, and adapt to evolving risks in automated decision-making. Overall, the changes promote greater accountability and security, particularly for higher-risk systems, while maintaining core effective dates from April 1, 2019.

## Detailed Changes

The detailed changes are organized by section, based on the XML structure. Where possible, I reference anchors (e.g., chapter and clause anchors), previous wording, and new wording. Due to the incomplete nature of the snippets, some changes may be inferred, and not all sections are fully represented. The focus is on substantive differences in content, formatting (e.g., addition of HTML-like tags), and structural elements.

### Changes in Chapter 1: Effective Date

This chapter outlines when the directive takes effect and its applicability. The primary change is the addition of a sub-clause in Clause 1.2, introducing a provision for existing (legacy) systems. The 2025 version also includes minor formatting updates, such as the use of nested clauses, which were not present in the 2023 version.

#### Clause 1.1
- **Description:** This clause specifies the effective date of the directive and the compliance deadline. No significant content changes were observed, but there are minor differences in formatting and presentation.
- **Previous Wording (2023 Version):** "This directive takes effect on <time class="nowrap" datetime="2019-04-01">April 1, 2019</time>, with compliance required by no later than <time class="nowrap" datetime="2020-04-01">April 1, 2020</time>."
  - *Note:* The 2023 version uses HTML <time> elements for date formatting, which may improve accessibility or machine-readability.
- **New Wording (2025 Version):** "This directive takes effect on April 1, 2019, with compliance required by no later than April 1, 2020."
  - *Note:* The 2025 version omits the <time> tags, simplifying the text while retaining the same dates. This change does not alter the meaning but may affect how the document is rendered or parsed.

#### Clause 1.2
- **Description:** This clause defines the scope of the directive's application to automated decision systems. The key change is the addition of a new sub-clause (1.2.1) in the 2025 version, which introduces a grandfather clause for systems developed or procured before June 24, 2025. This was not present in the 2023 version, indicating an update to accommodate legacy systems and provide a transition period.
- **Previous Wording (2023 Version):** "This directive applies to all automated decision systems developed or procured after <time class="nowrap" datetime="2020-04-01">April 1, 2020</time>."
  - *Note:* The snippet cuts off here, but based on the provided text, there are no additional sub-clauses or references to legacy systems.
- **New Wording (2025 Version):** "This directive applies to all automated decision systems developed or procured after April 1, 2020. Existing automated decision systems developed or procured prior to June 24, 2025, will have unt..." (snippet incomplete, but likely continues with details on exemptions or compliance requirements).
  - **Added Sub-Clause 1.2.1 (New in 2025):** "Existing automated decision systems developed or procured prior to June 24, 2025, will have unt..." (incomplete in snippet).
    - *Rationale for Change:* This addition provides a specific cutoff date (June 24, 2025) for legacy systems, potentially exempting them from full compliance to avoid retroactive burdens. This reflects a policy evolution toward more flexible implementation, common in regulatory updates to balance innovation and oversight.

#### Sub-Clause 1.2.1
- **Description:** This is a new sub-clause in the 2025 version, absent from the 2023 version. It addresses transitional arrangements for pre-existing systems, enhancing clarity on non-retroactivity.
- **Previous Wording (2023 Version):** Not present; no equivalent clause or sub-clause exists.
- **New Wording (2025 Version):** "Existing automated decision systems developed or procured prior to June 24, 2025, will have unt..." (incomplete snippet; inferred to include provisions for phased compliance or exemptions).
  - *Impact:* For policy wonks, this change signals an intent to grandfather older systems, reducing immediate compliance costs while ensuring new systems meet updated standards. It may align with broader digital transformation initiatives.

### Changes in Appendices: Risk Assessment Table

The appendices contain a table outlining risk levels for automated decision systems, including requirements for human involvement, mandatory safeguards, and approval processes. The 2025 version shows a more detailed and structured table compared to the 2023 version. Key differences include expanded content, changes in section references, and updates to approval authorities. The 2025 table includes additional rows for human involvement and risk levels, which are not fully visible in the 2023 snippet. This suggests a restructuring to emphasize human-centric governance.

- **Structural Changes:** 
  - The 2025 version has a comprehensive table with multiple rows (e.g., for "Risk level", "Mandatory requirements", "Human involvement", and "Approval for the system to operate"). It uses a tbody and tr elements with explicit risk level columns (I to IV).
  - The 2023 version's snippet focuses primarily on the approval section, with less detail on other aspects. This indicates a possible expansion or reorganization in 2025 to provide more granular guidance on risk management.
  - *Rationale for Change:* The updates likely aim to address emerging concerns about AI ethics, bias, and accountability, aligning with international standards (e.g., EU AI Act influences).

#### Row: Approval for the System to Operate
- **Description:** This row specifies the approval authority based on risk levels. The section reference has changed, and approval requirements have been updated for consistency across risk levels.
- **Previous Wording (2023 Version):** Section reference is "section 6.3.12". The table cells show varying approval levels:
  - Column for lower risk levels: "None" (e.g., headers indicate no approval needed for some risks).
  - Higher risk levels: "Deputy Head" and "Treasury Board".
  - Example: "<th class="active" id="tbl71" headers="tbl5">Approval for the system to operate<br /><span class="nowrap">(section 6.3.12)</span></th><td headers="tbl6 tbl71"><p>None</p></td><td headers="tbl7 tbl71"><p>None</p></td><td headers="tbl8 tbl71"><p>Deputy Head</p></td><td headers="tbl9 tbl71"><p>Treasury Board</p></td></tr>"
- **New Wording (2025 Version):** Section reference updated to "section 6.3.14". Approval levels are now more explicitly tied to risk categories, with no "None" options for any level:
  - Example: "<th scope="row">Approval for the system to operate<br /> (section 6.3.14)</th><td>Assistant deputy minister responsible for the program.</td><td>Same as level I</td><td>Deputy head</td><td>Treasury Board </td></tr>"
    - *Specific Changes by Risk Level:*
      - Risk Level I: Changed from "None" to "Assistant deputy minister responsible for the program." – This escalates oversight for even low-risk systems.
      - Risk Level II: Implicitly "Same as level I" in 2025, compared to "None" in 2023 – Indicates a shift toward mandatory approvals.
      - Risk Level III: Remained similar ("Deputy head"), but with updated phrasing.
      - Risk Level IV: Unchanged ("Treasury Board"), ensuring high-level scrutiny for critical systems.
  - *Rationale for Change:* Elevating approval requirements reduces the risk of unchecked automated decisions, enhancing accountability. The section number change (6.3.12 to 6.3.14) may indicate added content in the main document, such as new subsections on governance.

#### Row: Human Involvement (New in 2025)
- **Description:** This row is a new addition in the 2025 version, emphasizing human oversight in automated decision-making. It was not present in the provided 2023 snippet, suggesting an expansion to address ethical and legal concerns.
- **Previous Wording (2023 Version):** Not present; the 2023 table snippet does not include a dedicated row for human involvement.
- **New Wording (2025 Version):** "<th scope="row">Human involvement<br />(section 6.3.8)</th><td>Explainability and transparency of decisions or recommendations.<br />Ability to contest the decision or recommendation made by the system.</td><td>Same as level I</td><td>The final decision must be made by a human.<br /> Decisions cannot be made without having clearly defined human involvement during the decision-making process.<br /> Humans review the decisions or recommendations made by the system for accuracy and appropriateness. Humans are to be involved in ongoing quality assurance and can intervene in the making of decisions and assessments made by the system.</td><td>Same as level III</td></tr>"
  - *Rationale for Change:* This addition mandates human involvement at higher risk levels, aligning with principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. For policy wonks, this could reflect responses to incidents of algorithmic bias or new regulatory pressures.

#### Other Table Rows (e.g., Risk Level, Mandatory Requirements)
- **Description:** The 2025 version includes rows for "Risk level" and "Mandatory requirements" that are not fully detailed in the 2023 snippet. These appear to elaborate on risk categorization and safeguards.
- **Previous Wording (2023 Version):** Not explicitly shown; the snippet jumps to approval, implying less comprehensive coverage.
- **New Wording (2025 Version):** For example, "Risk level" row includes definitions and references, while "Mandatory requirements" adds details like explainability and contestability.
  - *Rationale for Change:* Enhanced risk stratification improves implementation guidance, ensuring proportional controls based on system impact.

### General Observations
- **Formatting and Metadata:** The 2025 version uses simpler XML structure (e.g., no <time> tags), while the 2023 version incorporates more semantic elements. This may not affect policy content but could influence document interoperability.
- **Incomplete Snippets:** Due to ellipses in the provided XML, some sections (e.g., full table content or clause continuations) could not be fully compared. For instance, Clause 1.2.1 in 2025 is cut off, and the 2023 table may have additional rows not shown.
- **Implications for Policy Implementation:** These changes underscore a shift toward more robust governance in automated decision-making, with increased emphasis on human oversight and phased compliance. Policy wonks should note the potential for reduced barriers to adoption for legacy systems while strengthening controls for new deployments. If full documents are available, a deeper analysis could reveal additional changes in other chapters or appendices.
