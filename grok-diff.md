# Summary of Changes to the Directive on Automated Decision-Making

## Executive Summary

The Directive on Automated Decision-Making, identified by document ID 32592, has undergone significant updates between the versions dated April 25, 2023, and June 24, 2025. The overarching theme of these revisions centers on extending compliance timelines for existing systems and specific entities, refining the scope of application, and enhancing requirements for human involvement and training across various impact levels of automated decision systems. Major changes include:

- **Compliance Deadlines Extended:** The compliance deadline for existing automated decision systems has been extended from April 25, 2024, to June 24, 2026, aligning with a new benchmark date of June 24, 2025, for systems to be evaluated against.
- **Specific Compliance for Agents of Parliament:** A new provision mandates compliance for Agents of Parliament by June 24, 2026, which was not explicitly mentioned in the earlier version.
- **Enhanced Human Involvement and Training:** The requirements for human oversight, training, and approval processes have been detailed further, particularly specifying recurring training and explicit human involvement in decision-making for higher impact levels.
- **Approval Authority Updates:** There are changes in the approval authority for system operation, with higher impact levels now requiring approval from the Treasury Board or Deputy Head, as opposed to less stringent or no specific requirements in the previous version.

These updates reflect a policy shift towards more rigorous oversight and accountability in the deployment of automated decision systems, ensuring extended transition periods for compliance and emphasizing human intervention to mitigate risks associated with automation.

## Detailed Changes

1. **Effective Date and Compliance Timelines (Chapter 1, Effective Date)**
   - **Section 1.2.1 - Compliance Deadline for Existing Systems**
     - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** "...existing systems developed or procured prior to April 25, 2023, will have until April 25, 2024, to fully transition to the requirements in subsections 6.2.3, 6.3.1, 6.3.4, 6.3.5, and 6.3.6 in this directive."
     - **New Wording (2025-06-24):** "Existing automated decision systems developed or procured prior to June 24, 2025, will have until June 24, 2026, to comply with the new or updated requirements."
     - **Impact:** This change extends the compliance timeline by over two years for existing systems, adjusting the reference date for applicability and the deadline for compliance. It also broadens the scope to "new or updated requirements" rather than specifying particular subsections, potentially encompassing more comprehensive updates.
   - **Section 1.2.2 - Compliance for Agents of Parliament**
     - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** This specific provision was not present or was focused on new systems post-April 25, 2023, without mention of Agents of Parliament.
     - **New Wording (2025-06-24):** "Agents of Parliament will have until June 24, 2026, to comply with the requirements."
     - **Impact:** This addition explicitly includes Agents of Parliament under the directiveâ€™s purview with a specific compliance deadline, enhancing the scope of entities required to adhere to the directive.

2. **Human Involvement in Decision-Making (Appendix, Section 6.3.13)**
   - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** For higher impact levels, human involvement specifics were less detailed, lacking explicit requirements for ongoing human review and intervention processes across all levels.
   - **New Wording (2025-06-24):**
     - For Level I and II: "The system may make decisions and assessments without direct human involvement. Humans are to be involved in system quality assurance and can intervene in the making of decisions by the system where appropriate."
     - For Level III: "The final decision must be made by a human. Decisions cannot be made without having clearly defined human involvement during the decision-making process. Humans review the decisions or recommendations made by the system for accuracy and appropriateness. Humans are to be involved in ongoing quality assurance and can intervene in the making of decisions and assessments made by the system."
     - **Impact:** The updated directive explicitly mandates human oversight with specific roles at different impact levels. For higher levels (III), it ensures that humans are the final decision-makers, embedding a mandatory review process which was not as clearly articulated previously.

3. **Training Requirements (Appendix, Section on Training)**
   - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** Training requirements varied by level but lacked the emphasis on recurrence. For higher levels, it mentioned "training courses must be completed" and for the highest level, a "means to verify that training has been completed."
   - **New Wording (2025-06-24):** Includes explicit mention of "recurring training" across relevant levels, alongside topics such as bias mitigation and human rights implications, with consistent language like "Training must be recurring."
   - **Impact:** The emphasis on recurring training represents a shift towards continuous learning and awareness, ensuring that personnel remain updated on evolving challenges in automated decision-making, particularly around ethical considerations like bias and rights.

4. **Approval for System Operation (Appendix, Section 6.3.14 or 6.3.12 in 2023 version)**
   - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):**
     - Level I and II: "None" (no specific approval authority mentioned).
     - Level III: "Deputy Head."
     - Level IV: "Treasury Board."
   - **New Wording (2025-06-24):**
     - Level I and II: "Assistant deputy minister responsible for the program."
     - Level III: "Deputy Head."
     - Level IV: "Treasury Board."
   - **Impact:** The introduction of an approval authority for lower impact levels (I and II) at the Assistant Deputy Minister level adds a layer of accountability previously absent. The consistency in higher levels (III and IV) maintains existing rigorous oversight by senior officials, ensuring significant decisions are escalated appropriately.

These changes collectively indicate a policy evolution towards more inclusive compliance deadlines, explicit human oversight, continuous training, and structured approval processes, aiming to balance innovation in automation with ethical governance and risk management.

# Summary of Changes Between Versions of the Directive on Official Languages for People Management

## Executive Summary

The two versions of the "Directive on Official Languages for People Management" (document ID 26168), dated October 21, 2024, and June 20, 2025, were compared to identify substantive content changes. The theme of the changes appears to be minimal, with no significant alterations to the core policy requirements, effective dates, or linguistic obligations between the two versions. Both documents maintain the same structure, effective dates (including the November 19, 2012, start date and specific appendix implementation dates), and policy directives regarding bilingual staffing, linguistic profiles, and language of work provisions. There are no major changes to requirements or obligations for people management in terms of official languages within the federal public service. The content, including references to appendices and specific clauses about linguistic profiles and software language availability, remains identical in substance. This suggests that the updates between these versions may pertain to non-substantive aspects such as metadata, formatting, or minor editorial corrections not captured in the provided XML content.
