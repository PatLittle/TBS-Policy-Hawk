# Summary of Changes to the Directive on Automated Decision-Making (Document ID: 32592)

## Executive Summary

The Directive on Automated Decision-Making, updated from the version dated April 25, 2023, to the version dated June 24, 2025, reflects a significant shift toward extended compliance timelines and updated requirements for existing and new automated decision systems within Canadian governmental contexts. The primary theme of these revisions is to provide additional time for compliance, particularly for pre-existing systems and specific entities like Agents of Parliament, while refining operational and oversight requirements to ensure human involvement and accountability in automated decision-making processes.

**Major Changes to Requirements:**
- **Extended Compliance Deadlines:** The compliance deadline for existing systems has been extended from April 25, 2024, to June 24, 2026, and a specific compliance timeline is now provided for Agents of Parliament.
- **Enhanced Human Involvement:** There is a stronger emphasis on human oversight in decision-making processes, especially for higher impact levels, ensuring that final decisions are not fully automated without human intervention.
- **Updated Approval Authorities:** Approval requirements for system operation have been clarified and escalated for higher impact levels, involving senior authorities such as the Treasury Board.

## Detailed Changes

Below are the specific changes to the content of the Directive, organized by relevant sections or clauses with a focus on substantive policy updates. Where applicable, previous and new wording are provided for clarity.

### 1. Effective Date and Compliance Timelines (Chapter 1)
- **Clause 1.2.1 - Compliance Deadline for Existing Systems**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** "existing systems developed or procured prior to April 25, 2023, will have until April 25, 2024, to fully transition to the requirements in subsections 6.2.3, 6.3.1, 6.3.4, 6.3.5, and 6.3.6 in this directive."
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24):** "Existing automated decision systems developed or procured prior to June 24, 2025, will have until June 24, 2026, to comply with the new or updated requirements."
  - **Impact:** Extends the compliance deadline by over two years for existing systems, reflecting a pragmatic approach to implementation challenges faced by government entities.

- **Clause 1.2.2 - Compliance for Agents of Parliament**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** Focused only on new systems with no specific mention of Agents of Parliament.
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24):** "Agents of Parliament will have until June 24, 2026, to comply with the requirements."
  - **Impact:** Introduces a specific compliance timeline for Agents of Parliament, ensuring they are explicitly covered under the Directive with a clear deadline.

### 2. Human Involvement in Decision-Making (Appendix, Section 6.3.13)
- **Requirement for Human Involvement Across Impact Levels**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** Not explicitly detailed in the provided excerpt for all impact levels, with limited guidance on human intervention.
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24):** 
    - For Level I and II: "The system may make decisions and assessments without direct human involvement. Humans are to be involved in system quality assurance and can intervene in the making of decisions by the system where appropriate."
    - For Level III and IV: "The final decision must be made by a human. Decisions cannot be made without having clearly defined human involvement during the decision-making process. Humans review the decisions or recommendations made by the system for accuracy and appropriateness. Humans are to be involved in ongoing quality assurance and can intervene in the making of decisions and assessments made by the system."
  - **Impact:** Strengthens the requirement for human oversight, particularly at higher impact levels, ensuring that automated systems do not operate autonomously without human review and intervention. This addresses potential risks associated with fully automated decision-making in sensitive contexts.

### 3. Approval Authorities for System Operation (Appendix, Section 6.3.14)
- **Approval Requirements Across Impact Levels**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):**
    - Level I and II: "None"
    - Level III: "Deputy Head"
    - Level IV: "Treasury Board"
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24):**
    - Level I and II: "Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for the program."
    - Level III: "Deputy Head"
    - Level IV: "Treasury Board"
  - **Impact:** Introduces a formal approval process for lower impact levels (I and II) by involving the Assistant Deputy Minister, enhancing accountability. The higher levels (III and IV) remain consistent with previous requirements, maintaining rigorous oversight by senior authorities.

### 4. Training Requirements (Appendix, Assumed Section 6.3.x)
- **Training Specifications**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** For higher levels, required "Recurring training courses" and "A means to verify that training has been completed."
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24):** Explicitly states "Training must be recurring" and includes specific content areas such as understanding biases and human rights, and evaluating or overriding decisions.
  - **Impact:** Clarifies the scope and frequency of training, ensuring that personnel are continuously educated on critical aspects of automated systems, including ethical considerations and operational oversight.

### 5. IT and Business Continuity Management (Appendix, Section 6.3.8)
- **Continuity Planning**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** For Levels I and II, "None"; for Levels III and IV, required ensuring system recovery strategies and business continuity plans.
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24):** Not fully detailed in the provided excerpt, but implied consistency with previous requirements for higher levels.
  - **Impact:** Suggests continuity in prioritizing business continuity planning for higher impact systems, ensuring operational resilience in case of system unavailability.

## Conclusion

The updates to the Directive on Automated Decision-Making between April 25, 2023, and June 24, 2025, demonstrate a policy evolution aimed at balancing the practical challenges of implementing automated systems with the need for robust oversight and human involvement. Extended compliance timelines provide breathing room for government entities to adapt, while strengthened requirements for human intervention and approval processes underscore a commitment to accountability and risk mitigation in automated decision-making. These changes are particularly relevant for policy practitioners tasked with ensuring compliance and managing the integration of technology in public administration.
