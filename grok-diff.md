# Summary of Changes to the Directive on Automated Decision-Making (Document ID: 32592)

## Executive Summary

The two versions of the "Directive on Automated Decision-Making" (dated 2023-04-25 and 2025-06-24) reflect updates aimed at extending timelines for compliance, refining the scope of applicability, and adjusting operational requirements for automated decision systems. The primary theme of the changes is to provide more flexibility in implementation timelines for existing systems and specific entities (like Agents of Parliament) while maintaining the core principles of oversight, transparency, and human involvement in automated decision-making processes. 

Major changes include:
- **Extended Compliance Deadlines**: The deadline for existing systems to comply with updated requirements has been extended from April 25, 2024, to June 24, 2026. Additionally, Agents of Parliament have been given a specific compliance deadline of June 24, 2026.
- **Revised Applicability Dates**: The applicability of the directive to existing systems has been updated to reference a new baseline date (June 24, 2025, instead of April 25, 2023).
- **Operational Requirements Adjustments**: There are specific updates to approval authorities for system operation at different impact levels, with a notable change in the requirement for Level II systems to now need approval from the Assistant Deputy Minister.

These revisions indicate a policy shift towards accommodating operational realities and ensuring a smoother transition for organizations implementing or updating automated decision systems.

## Detailed Changes

Below are the specific substantive changes between the two versions of the directive, organized by section or topic area, with relevant previous and new wording where applicable.

### 1. Effective Date and Applicability (Chapter 1)
- **Section 1.2.1 - Compliance Deadline for Existing Systems**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25)**: "existing systems developed or procured prior to April 25, 2023, will have until April 25, 2024, to fully transition to the requirements in subsections 6.2.3, 6.3.1, 6.3.4, 6.3.5, and 6.3.6 in this directive."
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24)**: "Existing automated decision systems developed or procured prior to June 24, 2025, will have until June 24, 2026, to comply with the new or updated requirements."
  - **Analysis**: The baseline date for identifying existing systems has been updated from April 25, 2023, to June 24, 2025, and the compliance deadline has been extended by over two years to June 24, 2026. Additionally, the new wording broadens the compliance scope from specific subsections to "new or updated requirements."

- **Section 1.2.2 - Compliance for Agents of Parliament**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25)**: "new systems developed or procured after April 25, 2023, will have until April 25, 2024, to comply" (partial context; specific mention of Agents of Parliament is not clear in provided excerpt but implied as missing).
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24)**: "Agents of Parliament will have until June 24, 2026, to comply with the requirements."
  - **Analysis**: This introduces a specific compliance timeline for Agents of Parliament, aligning their deadline with that of existing systems (June 24, 2026). This was not explicitly detailed in the 2023 version excerpt provided.

### 2. Approval for System Operation (Appendix Section 6.3.14 or 6.3.12)
- **Approval Authority for Different Impact Levels**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25)**:
    - Level I: None
    - Level II: None
    - Level III: Deputy Head
    - Level IV: Treasury Board
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24)**:
    - Level I: Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for the program
    - Level II: Same as Level I (Assistant Deputy Minister)
    - Level III: Deputy Head
    - Level IV: Treasury Board
  - **Analysis**: The update introduces a requirement for approval by the Assistant Deputy Minister for Level I and Level II systems, where previously no specific approval was mandated for these levels. Levels III and IV remain unchanged, maintaining higher oversight for systems with presumably greater impact.

### 3. Human Involvement in Decision-Making (Appendix, Impact Level Requirements)
- **Human Involvement Requirements Across Impact Levels**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25)**: Not fully detailed in the provided excerpt, but inferred as consistent with general principles of human oversight.
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24)** (Excerpt from Levels I to IV):
    - Level I: "Humans are to be involved in system quality assurance and can intervene in the making of decisions by the system where appropriate."
    - Level II: "Same as Level I."
    - Level III: "The final decision must be made by a human. Decisions cannot be made without having clearly defined human involvement during the decision-making process. Humans review the decisions or recommendations made by the system for accuracy and appropriateness. Humans are to be involved in ongoing quality assurance and can intervene in the making of decisions and assessments made by the system."
    - Level IV: "Same as Level III."
  - **Analysis**: The 2025 version provides explicit and detailed expectations for human involvement at each impact level, emphasizing human oversight and intervention capabilities. While the 2023 version may have similar principles (not fully visible in excerpt), the 2025 wording is more prescriptive, particularly for Level III and IV systems, mandating a human final decision and ongoing quality assurance.

### 4. Other Requirements (Appendix, Various Sections)
- **IT and Business Continuity Management (Section 6.3.8)**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25)**: For Levels I and II: "None"; for Levels III and IV: "Ensure that system recovery strategies, business continuity plans, and other relevant security controls are established in coordination with designated officials should the automated decision system be unavailable."
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24)**: Not fully visible in the provided excerpt but assumed unchanged based on partial context.
  - **Analysis**: No explicit change noted in the provided excerpts for 2025-06-24; however, based on the 2023 wording, continuity planning remains mandatory only for higher impact levels (III and IV).

- **Training and Documentation (Inferred from 2023-04-25 Excerpt)**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25)**: Specifies requirements for documentation and training, with increasing rigor from Level I to IV (e.g., "Recurring training courses" and "a means to verify that training has been completed" for Level IV).
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24)**: Not fully detailed in the provided excerpt.
  - **Analysis**: Assumed unchanged unless further excerpts indicate otherwise. The focus on training and documentation likely remains consistent with progressive requirements based on impact level.

## Conclusion

The updates in the 2025-06-24 version of the Directive on Automated Decision-Making reflect a pragmatic approach to policy implementation, extending compliance timelines to accommodate existing systems and specific entities like Agents of Parliament. The changes also strengthen oversight by introducing approval requirements at lower impact levels and reinforcing the necessity of human involvement in decision-making processes. These adjustments are likely intended to balance the adoption of automated technologies with accountability and risk management in governmental operations. Policy analysts and implementers should note the extended deadlines (to June 24, 2026) and ensure that approval structures are updated to involve Assistant Deputy Ministers for Levels I and II systems.
