# Summary of Changes to the Directive on Automated Decision-Making (Document ID: 32592)

## Executive Summary

The Directive on Automated Decision-Making (Document ID: 32592) has undergone significant updates between the versions dated April 25, 2023, and June 24, 2025. The overarching theme of these changes appears to be an extension of compliance deadlines and an adjustment to applicability timelines for both existing and specific categories of automated decision systems. Additionally, there are notable revisions in operational and oversight requirements, reflecting a stronger emphasis on human involvement and higher-level approvals for certain systems. Major changes include:

- **Extended Compliance Deadlines**: The compliance deadline for existing automated decision systems has been extended by approximately two years, from April 25, 2024, to June 24, 2026. A similar extension applies to Agents of Parliament, aligning their compliance timeline with the new deadline.
- **Adjusted Applicability**: The directive now references systems developed or procured prior to June 24, 2025, rather than April 25, 2023, reflecting a forward shift in the cutoff date for existing systems.
- **Enhanced Oversight Requirements**: Changes in approval authority for system operation, particularly for higher impact levels (Level III and IV), now mandate involvement from senior officials like the Deputy Head and Treasury Board, respectively.

These updates indicate a policy shift towards providing more time for implementation while tightening governance structures around automated decision-making systems to ensure accountability and human oversight.

## Detailed Changes

Below are the specific substantive changes to the content of the Directive on Automated Decision-Making, organized by section or chapter where applicable, with comparisons of previous and new wording for clarity.

### 1. Effective Date and Applicability (Chapter 1)
- **Section 1.2.1 - Compliance Deadline for Existing Systems**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25)**: "existing systems developed or procured prior to April 25, 2023, will have until April 25, 2024, to fully transition to the requirements in subsections 6.2.3, 6.3.1, 6.3.4, 6.3.5, and 6.3.6 in this directive;"
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24)**: "Existing automated decision systems developed or procured prior to June 24, 2025, will have until June 24, 2026 to comply with the new or updated requirements."
  - **Impact**: The cutoff date for defining "existing systems" has been updated from April 25, 2023, to June 24, 2025, and the compliance deadline has been extended by two years, from April 25, 2024, to June 24, 2026. Additionally, the new wording broadens the scope to “new or updated requirements” rather than specifying particular subsections, potentially encompassing a wider range of compliance obligations.

- **Section 1.2.2 - Compliance for Agents of Parliament**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25)**: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpt, or wording related to new systems post-April 25, 2023.
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24)**: "Agents of Parliament will have until June 24, 2026, to comply with the requirements."
  - **Impact**: This is a new provision specifying a compliance deadline for Agents of Parliament, aligning with the extended timeline for existing systems. This inclusion reflects a targeted policy adjustment to ensure specific governmental entities are accounted for under the directive.

### 2. Approval and Oversight Requirements (Appendix - Impact Level Requirements Table)
- **Approval for System to Operate (Section 6.3.14 or 6.3.12)**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25)**:
    - Level I: "None"
    - Level II: "None"
    - Level III: "Deputy Head"
    - Level IV: "Treasury Board"
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24)**:
    - Level I: "Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for the program."
    - Level II: "Same as level I" (Assistant Deputy Minister)
    - Level III: "Deputy Head"
    - Level IV: "Treasury Board"
  - **Impact**: The approval process for lower impact levels (I and II) has been formalized with a requirement for approval by the Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for the program, introducing a layer of accountability that was previously absent ("None"). Levels III and IV remain unchanged, maintaining higher-level oversight by the Deputy Head and Treasury Board, respectively. This change indicates a policy intent to increase governance over all levels of automated decision systems.

- **Human Involvement in Decision-Making (Impact Level Requirements Table)**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25)**: Not fully provided in the excerpt, but inferred to be less detailed or prescriptive based on content structure.
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24)**:
    - Level III: "The final decision must be made by a human. Decisions cannot be made without having clearly defined human involvement during the decision-making process. Humans review the decisions or recommendations made by the system for accuracy and appropriateness. Humans are to be involved in ongoing quality assurance and can intervene in the making of decisions and assessments made by the system."
    - Level IV: "Same as level III"
  - **Impact**: The new version explicitly mandates human involvement in decision-making for Levels III and IV, emphasizing that the final decision must be human-made and that there must be clear human oversight throughout the process. This represents a strengthening of human accountability, ensuring that automated systems do not operate autonomously at higher impact levels.

### 3. Other Operational Requirements
- While the provided excerpts do not fully detail all changes in other areas (e.g., IT and business continuity management, training requirements), a cursory comparison suggests consistency in some areas with potential minor updates not explicitly covered in the provided text snippets. For instance, training and documentation requirements appear to retain similar structures but may include additional specifics or rigor in the 2025 version based on the trend towards increased oversight.

## Conclusion

The updates to the Directive on Automated Decision-Making reflect a deliberate policy adjustment aimed at balancing implementation feasibility with strengthened governance. The extended compliance timelines provide organizations with additional time to adapt, particularly for existing systems and Agents of Parliament, while new requirements for approval and human involvement underscore a commitment to accountability and risk mitigation in the use of automated decision systems. Policy analysts and implementers should note these changes as indicative of a maturing regulatory framework that prioritizes both practicality and oversight in the deployment of such technologies.

     - **Previous and Current Wording (key points in list form)**:
       - "This includes software applications, such as an office automation suite (word processor, electronic document management, spreadsheet, e-mail, etc.) made available to employees to perform their duties."
       - "In general, this does not include specialized software such as that used by system managers and support technicians to install, configure, maintain and manage the underlying software and hardware infrastructure that makes the institution's software suite available to employees."
       - "Regularly and widely used information technology systems, including software packages, acquired or produced by or on behalf of institutions after January 1, 1991, are available in both official languages."

Core elements such as effective dates, linguistic profile requirements, software language policies, and regional definitions are consistent across both versions. For policy wonks, this confirms that there are no new compliance requirements or shifts in operational guidance between these iterations. Any differences are likely limited to non-substantive XML markup or formatting, which are outside the scope of this analysis.
