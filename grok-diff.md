# Summary of Changes between Versions of "Policy on Service and Digital" Document (Document ID: 32603)

## Executive Summary

The two versions of the "Policy on Service and Digital" document, dated December 2, 2024, and August 29, 2025, reflect minor content updates with a focus on improving clarity, consistency, and precision in terminology and definitions. The thematic emphasis of the changes centers on refining language for better readability and standardization of terms, particularly in the context of service delivery and data management. There are no major substantive changes to policy requirements or mandates, such as new obligations or shifts in scope. Instead, the updates primarily involve stylistic edits (e.g., capitalization of defined terms), slight rephrasing for clarity, and minor grammatical corrections. Key areas of focus include the definitions section, where terms like "real-time performance data" and "repository" have been adjusted for consistency, and introductory sections with minor formatting or textual refinements. These changes suggest an intent to maintain alignment with evolving best practices in policy communication without altering the core intent or requirements of the policy.

## Detailed Changes

Below are the specific content changes identified between the two versions of the document, organized by section where possible. For each change, the previous wording (from the December 2, 2024 version) and the new wording (from the August 29, 2025 version) are provided where relevant, focusing on substantive edits rather than XML markup or structural differences.

1. **Note to Reader Section**
   - **Change**: Minor textual adjustment in the introductory note about the policy's effective date and replaced policies.
     - **Previous Wording (2024-12-02)**: "The Policy on Service and Digital and the Directive on Service and Digital took effect on April 1, 2020. They replace the:"
     - **New Wording (2025-08-29)**: "The Policy on Service and Digital and the Directive on Service and Digital took effect on <time class='nowrap' datetime='2020-04-01'>April 1, 2020</time>. They replace the:"
     - **Analysis**: The change introduces a time element for formatting the date but does not alter the substance of the statement.

   - **Impact**: No change in policy intent or requirements; purely a stylistic update.

2. **Definitions Section (Appendix)**
   - Several terms in the definitions appendix have been updated for consistency in capitalization and minor rephrasing. The following specific changes are noted:

       - **Impact**: Stylistic update for consistency; no substantive change.
     - **Term: Service**
       - **Previous Wording (2024-12-02)**: "Service ... Provision of a specific final output that addresses one or more needs of an intended recipient and contributes to the achievement of an outcome."

   - **Analysis**: This appears to be a stylistic decision to standardize how terms are presented, likely to align with policy drafting guidelines or improve readability. No changes to the meaning or application of the terms are evident.
   - **Impact**: Editorial in nature; no effect on policy requirements or interpretation.

## Conclusion

The updates between the December 2, 2024, and August 29, 2025, versions of the "Policy on Service and Digital" are editorial and stylistic, with no significant alterations to the policy's substantive requirements, scope, or intent. The changes primarily involve standardizing capitalization of defined terms, minor grammatical corrections, and slight rephrasing for clarity in definitions and introductory text.

# Summary of Changes to the Directive on Automated Decision-Making (Document ID: 32592)

## Executive Summary

The revisions to the "Directive on Automated Decision-Making" between the versions dated April 25, 2023, and June 24, 2025, reflect a commitment to extending compliance timelines, updating procedural requirements, and enhancing oversight for automated decision systems within Canadian government operations. The primary theme of these updates is to provide more time for existing systems and specific entities to adapt to the directive’s requirements, while also tightening governance and accountability measures for higher impact systems. Key changes include:

- **Extended Compliance Deadlines:** Existing automated decision systems and Agents of Parliament now have until June 24, 2026, to comply with new or updated requirements, an extension from the previous deadlines of April 25, 2024, for existing systems.
- **Refined Approval Authorities for System Operation:** The approval process for operating automated decision systems has been updated, particularly for higher impact levels (Level III and IV), shifting from "Deputy Head" to "Deputy Head" for Level III and maintaining "Treasury Board" for Level IV, but with slight nuances in documentation wording.
- **Enhanced Human Involvement Requirements:** The directive strengthens the emphasis on human oversight in decision-making processes, particularly for higher impact levels, ensuring human intervention is clearly defined and mandatory.

These updates indicate a balance between providing flexibility for implementation and ensuring robust governance and accountability in automated decision-making processes.

## Detailed Changes

Below are the specific content changes between the two versions of the directive, organized by relevant sections and focusing on substantive policy updates.

### 1. Effective Date and Compliance Timelines (Chapter 1: Effective Date)

- **Section 1.2.1 - Compliance Deadline for Existing Systems**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** "Existing systems developed or procured prior to April 25, 2023, will have until April 25, 2024, to fully transition to the requirements in subsections 6.2.3, 6.3.1, 6.3.4, 6.3.5, and 6.3.6 in this directive."
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24):** "Existing automated decision systems developed or procured prior to June 24, 2025, will have until June 24, 2026 to comply with the new or updated requirements."
  - **Impact:** The compliance deadline for existing systems has been extended by over two years, and the scope of requirements is generalized to "new or updated requirements" rather than specific subsections. This change provides additional time for organizations to adapt existing systems to the directive's standards.

- **Section 1.2.2 - Compliance for Specific Entities**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** "New systems developed or procured after April 25, 2023..." (incomplete in provided excerpt, but context suggests focus on new systems).
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24):** "Agents of Parliament will have until June 24, 2026, to comply with the requirements."
  - **Impact:** This newly specified clause targets Agents of Parliament with a distinct compliance deadline of June 24, 2026, aligning with the extended timeline for existing systems. This tailored approach acknowledges potential unique challenges faced by these entities.

### 2. Human Involvement in Decision-Making (Appendix Table - Human Oversight Requirements)

- **Section: Human Involvement in Decision-Making (Appendix Table)**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):** Specific details not fully provided in the excerpt, but implied to be less detailed or prescriptive regarding human involvement across impact levels.
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24):** For Level III and IV systems, "The final decision must be made by a human. Decisions cannot be made without having clearly defined human involvement during the decision-making process. Humans review the decisions or recommendations made by the system for accuracy and appropriateness. Humans are to be involved in ongoing quality assurance and can intervene in the making of decisions and assessments made by the system."
  - **Impact:** The revised text explicitly mandates human involvement at critical decision-making stages for higher impact systems, emphasizing accountability and oversight. This is a strengthening of requirements for Levels III and IV, ensuring automated decisions are not finalized without human review and intervention where necessary.

### 3. Approval for System Operation (Appendix Table - Approval Requirements)

- **Section: Approval for the System to Operate (Appendix Table, Section 6.3.14 in 2025-06-24, Section 6.3.12 in 2023-04-25)**
  - **Previous Wording (2023-04-25):**
    - Level I: "None"
    - Level II: "None"
    - Level III: "Deputy Head"
    - Level IV: "Treasury Board"
  - **New Wording (2025-06-24):**
    - Level I: "Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for the program"
    - Level II: "Same as Level I"
    - Level III: "Deputy Head"
    - Level IV: "Treasury Board"
  - **Impact:** The updated directive introduces a specific approval authority for lower impact levels (I and II) by assigning responsibility to the Assistant Deputy Minister, a shift from no specified approval previously. Levels III and IV remain consistent, maintaining high-level oversight for systems with significant impact. This change enhances accountability by ensuring even lower-impact systems receive formal approval, albeit at a more operational level.

### 4. Additional Observations
- **General Tone and Emphasis:** The 2025 version places greater emphasis on clarity and specificity in governance structures, particularly around compliance timelines and human oversight. While some content appears consistent across versions (e.g., IT and business continuity management requirements in the appendix table), the provided excerpts suggest an overarching intent to refine implementation details.
- **Section Numbering Discrepancy:** Note that the section reference for approval requirements changed from 6.3.12 (2023) to 6.3.14 (2025), potentially indicating restructuring or additional content not fully visible in the provided snippets.

## Conclusion

The updates to the Directive on Automated Decision-Making from April 25, 2023, to June 24, 2025, demonstrate a policy evolution aimed at balancing implementation feasibility with strengthened governance. Extended compliance deadlines provide practical relief for existing systems and specific entities like Agents of Parliament, while enhanced requirements for human involvement and approval processes underscore a commitment to accountability in automated decision-making. These changes are critical for policy stakeholders to note, as they impact timelines for compliance, roles and responsibilities for oversight, and the integration of human judgment in high-stakes automated systems.

## Detailed Changes

Below are the specific changes identified between the January 10, 2024, and August 29, 2025, versions of the document, organized by section with relevant previous and new wording provided where applicable.

### Chapter 1: Effective Date
1. **Clause 1.1 - Date Formatting for Effective Date**
   - **Location**: Chapter 1, Clause 1.1
   - **Change**: The effective date format has been updated to include a `time` element for clearer machine-readable formatting.

   - **New Wording (2025-08-29)**: "This directive takes effect on <time class='nowrap' datetime='2020-04-01'>April 1, 2020</time>."
   - **Impact**: This change does not alter the content or policy but improves technical formatting for consistency and accessibility.

2. **Clause 1.2 - Formatting of Replacement Policy Dates**
   - **Location**: Chapter 1, Clause 1.2 (sub-clauses 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4)
   - **Change**: Dates for replaced policy instruments have been formatted using `time` elements, and a typographical error in numbering (1.2.2. to 1.2.2) has been corrected.
   - **Previous Wording (2024-01-10)**:
     - 1.2.1: "Directive on Management of Information Technology, April 1, 2009"
     - 1.2.2.: "Directive on Information Management Roles and Responsibilities, October 8, 2007"
     - 1.2.3: "Directive on Recordkeeping, June 1, 2009"
   - **New Wording (2025-08-29)**:
     - 1.2.1: "Directive on Management of Information Technology, <time class='nowrap' datetime='2009-04-01'>April 1, 2009</time>"
     - 1.2.2: "Directive on Information Management Roles and Responsibilities, <time class='nowrap' datetime='2007-10-08'>October 8, 2007</time>"
     - 1.2.3: "Directive on Recordkeeping, <time class='nowrap' datetime='2009-06-01'>June 1, 2009</time>" (Note: Text appears truncated in the provided sample as "Ju...")
   - **Impact**: These changes standardize date presentation and correct minor errors, with no substantive impact on policy content. The truncation in 1.2.3 in the 2025 version appears to be an artifact of the excerpt provided and requires verification for completeness.

### Appendix K: Standard on Data Reference Standards
1. **Link Formatting and Presentation**
   - **Location**: Appendix K
   - **Change**: The formatting of links to data reference standards has been adjusted. In the 2024 version, links were presented in separate paragraphs, whereas in the 2025 version, they are combined in a single paragraph with `<br/>` elements separating them.
   - **Previous Wording (2024-01-10)**:
     - Separate `<p>` tags for each link, e.g., `<p><a href="...">Data reference standard on industry classification system</a></p>`
   - **New Wording (2025-08-29)**:
     - Single `<p>` tag with links separated by `<br/>`, e.g., `<p><a href="...">Data reference standard on industry classification system</a><br/><a href="...">Data reference standard on codes for current and past official names...</a><br/>...</p>`
   - **Impact**: This change in presentation improves the visual compactness of the appendix without altering the content or accessibility of the referenced standards.

   - **Location**: Appendix L
   - **Change**: The URL for the "Standard for Managing Metadata" has been updated to include the full domain path.
   - **Previous Wording (2024-01-10)**: `<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32786">Standard for Managing Metadata</a>`
   - **New Wording (2025-08-29)**: `<a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32786">Standard for Managing Metadata</a>`
   - **Impact**: This update ensures the link is absolute rather than relative, improving accessibility and reducing the risk of broken links when accessed from different contexts. The content of the referenced standard remains unchanged.

## Conclusion
The revisions between the January 10, 2024, and August 29, 2025, versions of the "Directive on Service and Digital" are technical and stylistic in nature, with no significant alterations to policy requirements or substantive content. The changes focus on improving date formatting, correcting minor errors, and refining the presentation of external links in appendices. Policy wonks should note that compliance obligations remain consistent across both versions, and attention to these updates is primarily relevant for ensuring accurate referencing and documentation practices. A full review of the complete 2025 document is recommended to confirm any truncated content (e.g., in Clause 1.2.3) not fully captured in the provided excerpt.
