This guideline is intended for departments to which the Policy  applies (see <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27122&amp;section=text#cha2">Section  2 of the Policy</a>). Other Government of Canada institutions are encouraged to  follow the advice in this guideline, as appropriate.</p><p>This guideline was prepared by the Chief Information Officer  Branch of the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat in consultation with  departments and agencies. It replaces those sections of the <em>Guideline for External Use of Web 2.0</em> that relate to the use of social media for professional and limited personal  use.</p></chapter><chapter anchor="2" title="1. Introduction"><p>The widespread adoption of the Internet and the rapid  evolution of networks and devices have changed the way public servants work,  and have improved the ability to communicate, collaborate, and share  information and expertise. For many public servants this advancement has  inspired innovative ways of working, including: </p><ul><li>Conducting consultations on new policy  instruments through wikis; </li><li>Following and engaging experts and thought  leaders on social media platforms; </li><li>Submitting questions or requests through the  Internet and social media; and</li><li>Accessing information via smartphones and other  user devices.</li></ul><p>The Policy requires departments to ensure acceptable and  efficient use of Government of Canada electronic networks and devices and to  provide open access to Web 2.0 tools and services, in accordance with the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578"><em>Policy on Government Security</em></a>. This  guideline defines professional and personal use of Government of Canada  electronic networks, devices and Web 2.0 tools and services. This guideline  also provides practical advice and tools that relate to the implementation of  the Policy requirements.</p><p>Departments are encouraged to consider these best practices  when developing their implementation plans. </p></chapter><chapter anchor="3" title="2. Defining Professional and Personal Use"><p>In an interactive and mobile work environment, it is  important that employees are aware of the expectations of acceptable use when  using Government of Canada electronic networks and devices, and Web 2.0 tools  and services. This is particularly pertinent given that the networks, devices  and social media platforms used for professional purposes are sometimes the  same as those used for personal activities, thus potentially blurring the  boundaries between the professional and personal use by public servants.</p><p>This guideline applies to professional and personal use of  Government of Canada electronic networks and devices, and Web 2.0 tools and  services by <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#ai">authorized individuals</a>,  irrespective of location of access. This includes using government-issued  devices on government and public networks, as well as using personal devices,  if permitted, on Government of Canada networks (e.g., use of a Virtual Private  Network on a personal computer).</p><section anchor="3.1" title="2.1 Social Media Activities"><p>Social media and other Web 2.0 tools and services are  providing new opportunities for networking and collaborating. There are three  key types of use:</p><p>"Professional use", which refers to the use of a personal  social media account for purposes related to professional activities, such as  communicating with professional associations, professional networking (e.g.,  participating in an online conference), gathering and sharing knowledge (e.g.,  using Twitter to stay up-to-date on trends or visiting government Facebook  pages) and career development (i.e., maintaining a LinkedIn profile).</p><p>"Personal use", which refers to the use of a personal social  media account for purposes unrelated to professional development or employment  (e.g., blogging about gardening tips, checking the weather or bus schedules, or  sharing personal or family photos). This type of use is limited and must be  conducted on personal time.</p><p>A third category is "official use". Only those individuals  who have been authorized to represent the Government of Canada can use official  social media accounts. Advice on the official use of social media is provided  in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27517"><em>Guideline on Official Use of Social Media</em></a>.</p><p><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#appF">Appendix F</a> provides sample learning tools related to employee use of social media.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Adherence  to the behaviours outlined in the <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049"><em>Values and Ethics Code of the Public Sector</em></a> and departmental  codes of conduct is expected for all types of use of electronic networks, devices  and Web 2.0 tools and services, including social media. It is important to  apply the same judgement to online activities as would apply to similar  activities offline. Examples of acceptable and unacceptable use are provided in <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27122&amp;section=text#appB">Appendix  B of the Policy</a> and <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27122&amp;section=text#appC">Appendix  C of the Policy</a>.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="4" title="3. Planning for Implementation"><p>The expected results of the Policy are that authorized  individuals use Government of Canada electronic networks and devices in an  acceptable manner and that they have open access to WebÂ 2.0 tools and  services on the appropriate Government of Canada network domains and associated  devices. Formulating a course of action to implement the Policy requirements in  a timely and effective manner is critical to achieving these outcomes.</p><p>A department's approach to planning for implementation will  be affected by a number of variables that depend on the department's current  state of open access. Departments are encouraged to adapt these recommendations  to their own needs.</p><p>As a best practice, departments are encouraged to conduct  the following activities as part of the planning process:</p><ol><li>Identify a departmental champion; </li><li>Conduct a gap analysis; </li><li>Engage departmental subject matter experts; and</li><li>Develop an implementation plan.</li></ol><section anchor="4.1" title="3.1 Identifying a Champion"><p>Implementation is the process of turning policy into  practice. Executive support can increase the potential for success in  implementing the Policy. An effective champion can provide strategic direction  to inform the development of an implementation plan and assist in securing the  resources needed for implementation. The champion can also be an agent of  change.</p><p>The Policy requires open access to Internet tools and  services, which for some departments will require  a culture shift. The  presence of an influential leader can help form a new shared value by  encouraging others to work differently by promoting the acceptable use of  Government of Canada electronic networks and devices, and Web 2.0 tools and  services and open access to Internet tools, and by demonstrating change through  positive results. </p></section><section anchor="4.2" title="3.2 Conducting a Gap Analysis"><p>A gap analysis involves determining what steps need to be  taken to move from a current state to a target state. Knowledge of expected  practices in the target state can help identify actions to close any potential  gaps. Departments may wish to frame their gap analyses by using the  requirements of the Policy as the future state and determining what gaps exist  between the current and future states. Departments can then propose actions to  fill the gaps. Highlighting deficiencies will help create the basis of an  implementation plan, within which departments can include the resources needed  to meet the objectives. </p></section><section anchor="4.3" title="3.3 Engaging Departmental Subject Matter Experts"><p>Engaging the right people through existing  departmental networks or through the creation of a team of experts can support  the Policy's implementation goals. It can also demonstrate a more coherent  approach to the champion and other executives. It is recommended that  departmental representatives be consulted throughout the life cycle of  implementation, to ensure that relevant policy and legal considerations are  met. <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#appB">Appendix B</a> suggests the departmental experts that could be involved and the value they can  add.</p></section><section anchor="4.4" title="3.4 Developing an Implementation Plan"><p>Developing a formal implementation plan can build a common  understanding about what is to be achieved, and the roles and responsibilities  of those involved in implementing the Policy. It is a good practice to create  an implementation plan in consultation with the members of the team of experts.  It is suggested that the plan include the following:</p><ul><li>Purpose;</li><li>Background or Introduction;</li><li>Goals;</li><li>Consultations;</li><li>Roles and Responsibilities;</li><li>Key Tasks;</li><li>Resources;</li><li>Risk Mitigation; and</li><li>Performance Measurement and Evaluation.</li></ul><p>An example of an Implementation Plan Template is provided in <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#appC">Appendix C</a>.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="5" title="4. Implementing the Requirements of the Policy"><p>The objective of the Policy is to ensure acceptable and  efficient use of Government of Canada electronic networks and devices, and Web  2.0 tools and services to support enhanced communication and collaboration,  thereby improving productivity and program and service delivery to individuals  and businesses.</p><p><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27122&amp;section=text#cha6">Section  6 of the Policy</a> states that deputy heads are responsible for ensuring that:</p><ul><li>Effective management and monitoring practices  for the acceptable use of Government of Canada electronic networks and devices,  and Web 2.0 tools and services are implemented; </li><li>Authorized individuals are informed of the  expectations of acceptable use of Government of Canada electronic networks and  devices, and Web 2.0 tools and services, departmental monitoring practices and  consequences of unacceptable use;</li><li>Open access to the Internet and Web 2.0 tools  and services is implemented while meeting the security objectives of the <em>Policy on Government Security</em>; </li><li>Learning opportunities regarding the acceptable  use of Government of Canada electronic networks and devices and Government of  Canada and external Web 2.0 tools and services are provided to authorized  individuals; and</li><li>Reports on the use of Government of Canada  networks and devices are made available monthly and as required, to help deputy  heads identify, investigate and implement corrective action on issues relating  to unacceptable use.<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#ftn1" id="ftnref1"><span class="cn-invisible"> See footnote </span><sup>1</sup></a></li></ul><section anchor="5.1" title="4.1 Establishing Effective Management and Monitoring Practices"><p>Effective management involves planning, coordinating and  monitoring to accomplish desired goals and objectives while using available  resources efficiently. Sound operational practices can aid departments in  adequately protecting departmental and informational assets and allowing  authorized individuals to use networks and devices effectively, efficiently and  securely. </p><p>As a best practice, departments may want to review existing  operational management practices for opportunities to optimize and to validate  that the appropriate resources and tools supporting the implementation of the  Policy are well coordinated. Finally, ensuring effectiveness of these operating  practices through periodic reviews can help ensure ongoing compliance with the  Policy.</p><p>Examples of best practices are:</p><ul><li><strong>Establishing monitoring practices:</strong><ul><li>Defining requirements for regular and special  practices for monitoring networks and devices for acceptable use;</li><li>Communicating monitoring requirements to  departmental representatives or Shared Services Canada equivalents responsible  for managing network and device monitoring tools; and</li><li>Coordinating and implementing modifications to  monitoring practices as a result of corrective action measures. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Managing appropriate and inappropriate use:</strong><ul><li>Communicating monitoring practices to authorized  individuals accessing networks and devices, and any subsequent changes to  practices; </li><li>Receiving, tracking and responding to questions  about the Policy;</li><li>Responding to requests received from management  to investigate suspected cases of unacceptable use;</li><li>Informing the Champion and other executives of  compliance with the Policy, including incidents and corrective action measures;</li><li>Submitting requests for special monitoring to  departmental or Shared Services Canada representatives when potential issues of  unacceptable use arise;</li><li>Handling confirmed cases of unacceptable use  detected by network and device monitoring tools (examples of informal and  formal approaches are outlined in <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#appD">Appendix D</a>); and</li><li>Informing departmental security officials if a  security incident resulting from unacceptable use is suspected or confirmed.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Reporting:</strong><ul><li>Receiving data on a monthly basis from the  various monitoring tools for analysis to ensure compliance with the Policy; and</li><li>Requesting the generation of unscheduled reports to  assist in the investigation of suspected cases of unacceptable use of  electronic networks, devices and Web 2.0 tools and services.</li></ul></li></ul></section><section anchor="5.2" title="4.2 Informing Authorized Individuals"><p>Communication plays a pivotal role in the successful  implementation and application of a policy. Key messages can be developed and  communicated using different channels of delivery, ensuring that managers are  informed of their responsibilities and that employees are briefed on what is  expected of them.</p><p>Authorized individuals who use Government of Canada  electronic networks and devices, and WebÂ 2.0 tools and services must be  informed of expectations for acceptable use, departmental monitoring practices and  consequences of unacceptable use. Sample statements for consideration are  available in <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#appE">Appendix E</a>.</p><p>There are several options, both formal and informal, to  consider when disseminating required information (<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#appF">Appendix F</a> provides sample learning tools directed to authorized individuals), such  as: </p><ul><li>Network login acknowledgements and notifications  or security banners (<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#appG">Appendix G</a> provides examples of daily and quarterly network sign-on notifications); </li><li>Departmental electronic newsletters, pamphlets  and bulletins; </li><li>Intranets (e.g., Content pages, Frequently Asked  Questions (FAQs), wikis and blogs); </li><li>E-mail messages, which can be confirmed by an  electronic receipt; </li><li>Streaming video sites (e.g., <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRvY1SzWhl0&amp;list=TLzGuz2cZqZt7ROwwW_GJbyJ3ZRWaYL7aN">Transport  Canada Social Media at Work YouTube video</a>);</li><li>Topic discussions, lunch and learn sessions, and  team meetings; </li><li>Policy and procedures manuals or departmental  codes of conduct;</li><li>Orientation of new employees;</li><li>Information posted in common areas (e.g.,  posters and fact sheets);</li><li>Text included in user account application forms;  or</li><li>Terms of use agreements for department-issued  devices (e.g., smartphones, external storage devices and tablets), which are  signed before taking possession of these devices.</li></ul><p>Whether the Policy requirements are being communicated upon  the introduction of the new Policy, as part of ongoing awareness, or during  periods of amendments to the Policy, it is recommended that departments develop  a multi-faceted approach, using as many channels as possible to reach the  intended audience.</p><p>A best practice is to ensure that relevant information about  the Policy is available at all times on the departmental intranet or wiki. By  keeping information up to date, departments can adapt messaging to include  changes brought about by the introduction of new technologies and WebÂ 2.0  tools and services. </p></section><section anchor="5.3" title="4.3 Providing Open Access"><p>Open access to Government of Canada electronic networks and  devices, including internal and external Web 2.0 tools and services, is  essential in transforming the way public servants work and serve Canadians.  Open access to an array of Internet-based tools and services (e.g., <a href="http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/?setlang=en">GCpedia wiki</a>, <a href="http://gcconnex.gc.ca/">GCconnex</a> and social  networking platforms such as Twitter, YouTube and Facebook) can enhance  collaboration and communication. </p><p>The information gathered in the gap analysis, outlined  in <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#sec4.2">Section  3.2 of this Guideline</a>, may have identified the need to provide more  open access within the department to meet the Policy requirements. If a  strategy is needed to enhance access, the following components could be  considered:</p><h4>4.3.1. Identifying Needs and Aligning with Departmental Priorities</h4><ul><li>How are departmental priorities supported by  open access? </li><li>Which sites or groups of sites will support  authorized individuals' use of the network for government business and for  professional development (e.g., social media platforms where the department has  an official presence)?</li><li>Are there any responsibilities of specific  authorized individuals or groups of authorized individuals that may require  access to websites that would normally fall into the category of unacceptable  use (e.g., employees conducting investigation or policy research into an area  relating to criminal behaviour)? </li></ul><h4>4.3.2. Identifying and Overcoming Challenges of Providing Open Access</h4><ul><li>What are the perceived or real challenges to  providing open access?
            <ul><li>Information or information technology (IT)  security concerns;</li><li>Network bandwidth; </li><li>Employee productivity;</li><li>Access to information and privacy; and</li><li>Other.</li></ul></li><li>What are the risk mitigation strategies for  these challenges?
            <ul><li>Use Government of Canada issued devices;</li><li>Ensure that web browsers and associated  applications are up to date and support the functionality of modern websites  and tools;</li><li>Set bandwidth controls, providing reasonable  weekly or monthly limits on data use by authorized individuals;</li><li> Provide  warnings to employees if these limits are exceeded; </li><li>Develop a strategy to acquire more bandwidth  capacity as demand for resources continues to grow; and</li><li>Address employee inefficiency through human  resources management processes and consult with human resources to determine  the appropriate approach.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> See <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27122&amp;section=text#appE">Appendix  E of the Policy</a> for additional mitigation measures.</p><h4>4.3.3. Implementing Open Access</h4><p>As a baseline, departments could begin by providing default  access to social media platforms for which the department has an official  account registered, and by limiting access to functionality on those sites that  support the objectives of the Policy (e.g., prohibiting access to Facebook  games or applications). Departments are also encouraged to document their plans  for the incremental expansion of open access once a baseline is established.</p><p>In the rare case where business requirements or  operational circumstances may dictate the need for restricted access due to  security issues, options are available to departments to meet requirements of  the Policy. Some options include:</p><ul><li>Providing a standalone unclassified network on  which Web 2.0 tools are enabled; or</li><li>Installing kiosk stations or Wi-Fi hotspots that  provide open access.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> The  implementation of an environment supporting open access does not extend to  access from classified domains. Connectivity of the classified domains  continues to be regulated under existing policy and standards on government  security, as well as lead security agency and departmental direction.</p><p>It is suggested that departments provide a process for  authorized individuals to request access to new websites or online tools, which  can be considered in future plans to expand access, given security  considerations.</p><h4>4.3.4. Reviewing and Evaluating Open Access Practices</h4><p>Departments are encouraged to review their open  access practices on an annual basis to assess progress and to address issues  that arise regarding changes in policy or emerging technologies. This will also  ensure that open access is being provided in accordance with the <em>Policy on Government Security</em>. Appendix  E of the Policy provides guidance on security measures to support the  implementation of the Policy and to protect Government of Canada networks,  devices and information.</p></section><section anchor="5.4" title="4.4 Providing Learning Opportunities for Authorized Individuals"><p>In general, risks associated with unacceptable use, security  incidents, and privacy breaches can be minimized through the provision of  effective learning opportunities supported by an effective monitoring  capability. Learning activities can reinforce the role of managers and  authorized individuals in ensuring good practices and compliance with policy  requirements. </p><p>When generating awareness about the Policy, departments may  want to inform managers and supervisors of the implications of the new Policy  in advance. Their role can help ensure compliance with the Policy, thereby  assuring the operational effectiveness and integrity of the department. This  can also better equip management and supervisors to respond to questions from  employees. </p><p>Consideration may also be given to linking key messages  about expected behaviours when using Government of Canada networks, devices and  Web 2.0 tools to the <em><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049">Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</a></em> and the  departmental code of conduct. It may be important to reinforce that the same  rules regarding upholding the values of the public sector apply both online and  offline.</p><p>Learning opportunities may include, but are not limited  to:</p><ul><li>Information sessions (e.g., online or  in-person);</li><li>Orientation sessions for new employees,  including discussions on acceptable and unacceptable use of networks and  devices; </li><li>Canada School of Public Service and the Communications  Security Establishment IT Security Learning Centre course offerings; </li><li>Regular discussions between managers and their  staff;</li><li>Online learning products, including  self-assessment tests and YouTube videos;</li><li>Presentations at branch-level town halls, meetings  or workshops;</li><li>Communications products that can be distributed  to authorized individuals or posted in prominent locations in the workspace (<a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#appF">Appendix F</a> provides sample  communication tools);</li><li>Communities of practice discussions, either  in-person or via internal Government of Canada online collaborative tools;</li><li>Mentoring programs, especially when helping  employees transition to the use of Web 2.0 tools as part of their work; and</li><li>Leveraging existing activities (e.g., Security  Awareness Week) to communicate key messages about the Policy.</li></ul><p>Ongoing learning opportunities allow departments to  update information as Internet-based tools continue to evolve, and can be  supplemented with examples that represent the department's individual  circumstances. It is recommended that the definitions (in <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#appA">Appendix A</a>) and the lists of non-exhaustive  examples of acceptable and unacceptable use, as described in <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27122&amp;section=text#appB">Appendix B of the Policy</a> and <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27122&amp;section=text#appC">Appendix C of the Policy</a>, be considered when developing learning materials. Appendix F provides sample  learning tools.</p></section><section anchor="5.5" title="4.5 Monitoring Networks and Reporting"><p>Having the appropriate tools and processes in place to  identify and investigate suspected cases of unacceptable use can support the  accountability of deputy heads to address Policy non-compliance in an effective  and organized manner.</p><p>Data from network monitoring tools supply some of the  evidence needed to recognize and confirm incidents of unacceptable use. The  Policy requires that regular monthly, and as required, reports be provided  based on this data to assist departments in the identification, investigation,  and implementation of corrective action pertaining to unacceptable use. Where  network services are supplied by Shared Services Canada, the responsibility for  providing these reports lies with the deputy head of Shared Services Canada.  For those departments not served by Shared Services Canada, the responsibility  to meet this requirement resides with the individual department.</p><p>Following the validation of the initial implementation of  the Policy requirement regarding monitoring and reporting, departments may  consider liaising regularly with Shared Services Canada or the departmental  equivalent to ensure that monitoring tools are configured to generate the data  needed to assess the acceptable use of networks and devices.</p><p>Unacceptable use can range from minor to very serious  issues. Developing a Corrective Action Plan in advance to address incidents of  unacceptable use can assist the deputy head in resolving matters of  non-compliance efficiently and consistently. <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#appD">Appendix D</a> provides a list  of key elements and suggested options for remedial action that could be  included in a Corrective Action Plan.</p></section></chapter><chapter anchor="6" title="5.

A Corrective Action Plan is a  series of steps that are undertaken to address non-compliance and prevent its  reoccurrence. Remedial action does not always have to be reactive; preplanning  can potentially reduce the response time and increase the ability to handle  issues in a timely manner. </p><p>It is conceivable that options for addressing  different cases of unacceptable use may be available, depending on the severity  of the situation. Incidents of unacceptable use may be easily identified,  contained or eliminated through immediate corrective action, while others may  require a longer period of review to confirm the non-compliance, and to propose  and implement a resolution. In either situation, it is recommended that  departments be proactive in developing a Corrective Action Plan with options  for remedial action to ensure that instances of unacceptable use are handled  effectively and efficiently.</p><section anchor="D.1" title="Corrective Action Plan"><p>The details of a Corrective Action Plan will depend on departmental needs; however, the plan does not have to be overly complex to be practical. Some elements of a Corrective Action Plan could include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><div class="borderSimple"><h3 class="alignCenter darkgreyBG">Sample Corrective Action Plan Template</h3><h4 class="lightgreyBG">1.0 Document Title</h4><p><em>Corrective Action Plan for Incidents of Non-Compliance  With the "Policy on Acceptable Network and Device Use".</em></p><h4 class="lightgreyBG">2.0 Purpose</h4><p>This section states the goal(s) and objectives of the plan (i.e., what is to be achieved).</p><h4 class="lightgreyBG">3.0 Background or Introduction</h4><p>This section provides an overview of the corrective action process as well as high-level information about the requirements and the approach to implementing corrective action in suspected cases of non-compliance with the Policy. </p><h4 class="lightgreyBG">4.0 Corrective Action Plan Process</h4><p>This section outlines all actions needed to identify, investigate and resolve any deficiencies in meeting Policy requirements. </p><h4 class="lightgreyBG">5.0 Schedule of Activities</h4><p>This section maps the activities to a schedule, including target completion timelines for actions to alleviate immediate risks and in some cases, for preventive measures to curtail the threat of reoccurrence.</p><h4 class="lightgreyBG">6.0 Resources</h4><p>This section proposes the various resources needed to  implement the plan (e.g., human, financial, and software).

It will also validate the corrective action process and determine whether improvements are required.</p><h4 class="lightgreyBG">11.0 Reporting</h4><p>This section outlines the information to be included in the management report and the frequency with which the Champion and other executives will be informed of issues of non-compliance with the Policy, including any incidents and corresponding resolutions to mitigate future risks.</p></div></section><section anchor="D.2" title="Options for Remedial Action"><p>Triggers initiating a corrective action process can be  determined by analyzing network performance reports linked to data about  unacceptable use or by investigating a complaint of unacceptable use received  by a manager or another employee. This can lead to informal and more formal  remedial action to address issues of non-compliance, depending on the  seriousness of the problem.</p><p>In less severe cases, departments may want to consider a  more informal approach to address non-compliance. For example, excessive  bandwidth use could trigger a system-generated message to confirm whether  Policy non-compliance is linked to a legitimate work-related activity or to  address a minor non-malicious breach of the Policy without formal action being  taken. The preliminary notification can also be used as an awareness  opportunity to restate departmental bandwidth usage limits.</p><p>Processes for repeated unacceptable use may include  secondary or subsequent e-mail warnings to the authorized user, his or her  immediate supervisor, the branch executive and human resources to rectify the  issue. As a best practice a progressive approach is recommended, such as the  following:</p><ul><li>The first notification is sent to the authorized  individual to confirm unacceptable use, to remind the recipient of the Policy  requirements and how to avoid the unacceptable behaviour in the future;</li><li>The second notification is sent to the  authorized individual and his or her manager;</li><li>The third notification is sent to the authorized  individual, his or her manager, the branch executive and human resources, for  further follow-up.</li></ul><p>More formal methods of corrective action could be applied  upon repeated minor abuses of Government of Canada networks and devices by  those who have been previously warned of their unacceptable use or when serious  cases of unacceptable use have been confirmed. These corrective actions can  include an oral or a written reprimand, revocation or limitation of network  access, or suspension or termination of employment. It may be required that  each case of unacceptable use be assessed on an individual basis and reviewed  by the relevant departmental subject matter experts noted in <a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27907&amp;section=text#appB">Appendix B</a>.

Opportunities that now exist for networking and collaborating on a global scale were unthinkable a generation ago. The majority of Canadians now use social media on a regular basis and employees of the Government of Canada are no exception.</p><p>As the citizens, communities and clients served by government increase their use of Web 2.0 tools and services to organize, share, and interact, government employees are becoming more active in these online spaces in their roles as public servants. Whether using a wiki to develop a new policy instrument collaboratively, following and engaging with experts and  thought-leaders on Twitter, or managing an official departmental Facebook page  to answer questions from citizens, Web 2.0 tools and services are becoming a  larger part of our professional lives. These same Web 2.0 tools and services  are often used in our personal lives, blurring the boundaries between online  interactions as public servants and as private citizens. As the <a href="http://www.clerk.gc.ca/eng/feature.asp?pageId=297"><em>Prime Minister's Advisory Committee on the Public Service</em></a> noted, "These tools are transformative and unstoppable and the Public Service  must take full advantage of these new ways of working."</p><div class="borderSimple lightgreyBG"><h4 class="alignCenter">What is Web 2.0?</h4><p>"Web 2.0" is a broad term that refers to Internet-based tools and services that allow for participatory, multi-way information sharing, as opposed to earlier uses of the web that were primarily characterized by one-directional publishing of information. The term "Web 2.0" is often used interchangeably with "social media," and includes popular platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, or blogging platforms like Tumblr. These platforms allow participants to have a distinct user profile which they use to create and share user-generated content such as text, pictures or videos, and to facilitate community interaction. "Web 2.0" can also include technologies such as wikis or Google Docs, which allow multiple users to create and edit content collaboratively.</p></div><p>These new online collaboration tools offer tremendous benefits. However, in an era of instant global communications, it is important to consider the special responsibilities that we have as employees of the Government of Canada, including for the use of Government of Canada networks and devices. The public service has a long and proud tradition of providing impartial advice to the government of the day. This is derived from the importance and necessity of an impartial and effective public service to achieve its mission of helping the duly elected government, under law, to serve the public interest.</p><p>The <em>Policy on Acceptable Network and Device Use</em> applies whenever  using a Government of Canada network or a Government of Canada-issued device,  including a work computer while at the office, a work device (e.g., a  Government of Canada laptop or smartphone) on a home network, or a work or  personal device to remotely access a government network. When using the  Internet, social media and other Web 2.0 tools and services, it is important that Government of Canada employees consider the context of online activities and apply the same judgement that they would to a similar activity in the offline world.</p><div class="borderSimple lightgreyBG"><h4 class="alignCenter">Want to learn more about acceptable use of social media? </h4><p>For an engaging overview of important points to keep in mind  as an employee using social media, take a look at the online video âSocial  Media at Workâ, developed by Transport Canada and the Treasury Board of Canada  Secretariat.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Social_media_at_work_-_Les_m%C3%A9dias_sociaux_au_travail">GCpedia version</a></li><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRvY1SzWhl0">YouTube version</a></li></ul></div><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" class="widthFull"><caption><strong>Whenever    Using Social Media:</strong></caption><tr class="lightgreyBG"><th scope="col">Do</th><th scope="col">Donât</th></tr><tr><td>Use    good judgment and common sense in all you do; your obligations as a public    servant apply at all times.</td><td>Assume    that a post is private, even when using a pseudonym; treat online posts as if    they will be permanently and publicly available and attributable.</td></tr><tr><td>State    clearly in your social media profile (used for professional purposes) that    your views are your own, not those of your employer. <strong>Remember:</strong> This statement does not absolve you of your obligations    as a public servant or the expected behaviours described in the Values and    Ethics Code for the Public Sector and your departmental codes of conduct.</td><td>Disclose    any classified, confidential, sensitive, or third-party information, or    personal information about others.</td></tr><tr><td>Move    work-related conversations to official channels (e.g., e-mail) so that there    is a record of any guidance provided or decisions taken.</td><td>Use <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> corporate symbols or signatures inappropriately.

Frequently Asked Questions about the Policy on Acceptable Network and Device Use"><p>The following are examples of quick reference material that could be published on departmental intranets and wikis clarifying Policy requirements for authorized users of Government of Canada networks and devices, and Web 2.0 tools and services.</p><h4>Are public servants allowed to use the Internet and Web 2.0 tools and services?</h4><p>Yes! The use of, and open access to, the Internet through  Government of Canada electronic networks and devices is essential to  transforming the way public servants work and serve Canadians. Open access to  the Internet, including Government of Canada and external Web 2.0 tools and  services, enhances communication, collaboration and productivity, and  encourages the sharing of knowledge and expertise to support innovation. Open  access to the Internet, including Government of Canada and external Web 2.0  tools and services, will be provided by departments by April 1, 2014, through a  phased implementation of the new <em>Policy on Acceptable Network and Device Use</em> (the Policy). </p><h4>What is considered to be acceptable use?</h4><p><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27122&amp;section=text#appB">Appendix B of the Policy</a> provides examples of acceptable use of Government of Canada  networks and devices. Permitted use of Government of Canada electronic networks  and devices by authorized individuals includes:</p><ul><li>To perform activities as a part of their  official duties; </li><li>For career development and other professional  activities; and </li><li>For limited personal use that is conducted on  personal time; that is not for financial gain; that does not incur any  additional costs for the department; and that does not interfere with the  conduct of business. </li></ul><p>All use of Government of Canada electronic networks and  devices must be in compliance with the <em>Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</em> and all other  related Treasury Board policies and departmental codes of conduct and policies.  Use of Government of Canada electronic networks and devices must not give rise  to a real, potential or apparent conflict of interest or in any way undermine  the integrity of the department. </p><h4>What is considered to be unacceptable use?</h4><p><a href="/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27122&amp;section=text#appC">Appendix C of the Policy</a> provides examples of unacceptable use of Government of  Canada networks and devices. Unacceptable use refers to any activity that  violates Treasury Board or organizational policy instruments or other published  requirements, including, but not limited to, an activity or behaviour that:</p><ul><li>May give rise to criminal offences;</li><li>Violates federal or provincial statutes;</li><li>Impacts negatively on the performance of  Government of Canada electronic networks and devices;</li><li>Impedes departmental operations or the delivery  of services;</li><li>Breaches the âDuty of Loyaltyâ requirement for  public servants (e.g., impairing or seen to be impairing the objectivity and  impartiality of the public servant, the department or the Government of  Canada); or</li><li>Could result in liability.</li></ul><h4>What is a "Government of Canada electronic network or device?"</h4><p>Electronic networks are groups of computers and computer systems that can communicate with each other, including but not limited to, the Internet, Government of Canada electronic data networks, voice and video network infrastructures, and public and private networks external to a department. Networks include both wired and wireless components. Devices include anything approved for use to access these networks or network resources, such as a desktop, laptop or tablet computer, memory devices such as <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> flash drives, or a smartphone.</p><h4>How do the <em>Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</em> and my departmental code of conduct apply?</h4><p>It is important to remember that the <em>Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</em> and your  departmental code of conduct apply to online activities at all times, just as  they do to your offline activities, irrespective of whether they happen at work  or at home, or via a government or personally provided network or device.</p><p>Respecting the <em>Values  and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</em> and your departmental code of conduct  is a condition of employment in the public service.

Use of External Storage Devices"><p>The use of external storage devices can increase efficiency  and data mobility, as well as reduce the amount of physical space needed to  store information. However, these devices also present a risk for information  and IT security, privacy breaches and theft. It is important that departments  communicate to authorized individuals about the proper use of external storage  devices to minimize the risk involved.</p><p>An external storage device can include all <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> storage  devices (e.g., <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> drives, flash drives, thumb drives, jump drives, and memory  sticks), portable hard drives and any other device with storage capacity  connecting through a departmental corporate asset as well as other non-<abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> based portable devices (e.g., <abbr title="Compact Disc">CD</abbr>/<abbr title="Digital Versatile Disc">DVD</abbr>s and SD cards). Note: It may be beneficial  to provide examples of things that might not be top of mind but connect through <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr>-based and have storage capacity (e.g., cell and smartphones, and cameras).</p><p>When developing departmental guidance or direction on the  use of external storage devices, information provided may include:</p><ul><li>A description of the process for acquiring an  external storage device;</li><li>Departmental policy regarding unapproved or  unencrypted storage devices connecting to the network;</li><li>Requirements about the physical security of the  device since responsibility for the security of the device resides with the  user; </li><li>Risks associated with the use of the device and  the different security measures to minimize the risks including:
            <ul><li>Storing the device in a locked cabinet when not  in use;</li><li>Establishing strong passwords to protect  unauthorized access to the device; and</li><li>Ensuring that the device is not left unattended,  especially in a public area;</li></ul></li><li>Types/levels of encryption required for the  different work being performed;</li><li>Recordkeeping requirements of files stored on  the devices (e.g., files on the device are considered copies of the original  and they are not the primary record); </li><li>Backing up information since it may not be  recoverable if erased;</li><li>Requirements about personal information being  stored on external storage devices:

This reminder can also serve to offer learning  opportunities for authorized individuals.</p><h4>Your Monthly Security Reminder: Handling Your BlackBerry</h4><p>A departmental BlackBerry device comes with many  responsibilities for its protection and the data that it contains. If you have  been issued a departmental BlackBerry device, please keep the following in  mind:</p><ul><li>BlackBerry voice communications are not considered  secure, and as such, the device must not be used to discuss sensitive  information when used in phone mode. Blackberries deployed with  Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions functionality enabled can be used  to transmit data through electronic messaging up to and including the level of  Protected B. Classified information cannot be transmitted, either by voice or  data on a BlackBerry device;</li><li><abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>-to-<abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr> messaging, unlike BlackBerry e-mails,  is unencrypted, which means that the messages are not secure and should only be  used for unclassified and emergency communications; </li><li>If an employee no longer needs his or her  BlackBerry, it should not be used by another employee since its <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr> number is a  unique identifier for the device. If your BlackBerry is ârecycled,â a <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>-to-<abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr> message meant for you would unintentionally be sent to the employee  who now has the device; </li><li>BlackBerry <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>-to-<abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr> and text messages are  subject to Access to Information and Privacy (<abbr title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</abbr>) requests; </li><li>BlackBerry e-mail messages are vulnerable to the  same threats as other e-mail programs; these threats can include viruses,  Trojans and phishing attacks. If you receive an e-mail and do not recognize the  sender, do not open itââsimply delete it; </li><li>When using the camera feature of a BlackBerry,  be careful not to take photos of sensitive information or equipment; </li><li>Photos taken with a BlackBerry are subject to <abbr title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</abbr> requests and to the same records  retention criteria as other documents and correspondence; </li><li>Photos of colleagues should not be taken with a  BlackBerry or posted on social media without their consent. In addition, you  should carefully consider the photos that you choose to store in your Outlook  mailbox or on departmental network drives, since they take up large amounts of  valuable disk space;</li><li>Some devices will save key metadata (i.e.,  geolocation) whenever a photo is taken. This information may have privacy or  operational security implications and should be carefully scrutinized before  the posting of photos; and </li><li>If your BlackBerry is lost or stolen, report it  immediately by using the Self-Service tool or by contacting [contact name]. </li></ul><div class="alignCenter"><p><strong>Security: It's everyone's responsibility!</strong></p></div></section><section anchor="E.5" title="5. Smartphone Etiquette"><p>The use of smartphones is prevalent  in a mobile workplace. Although smartphones can enable greater connectedness  with colleagues and support increased productivity, they can also be  disruptive. Expecting a common sense approach to using these devices is not a  guarantee. To ensure that they are used in the manner for which they were  intended, Shared Services Canada (<abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>) has developed an <a href="http://extranet.ssc-spc.gc.ca/eng/forgovernment/it-infrastructure-services/cost-effective-telephone-services/ios-acd">Interim Operating Standard on the Acceptable Use of Cellular Devices</a>, which departments not receiving their  network services from <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> may find useful.
