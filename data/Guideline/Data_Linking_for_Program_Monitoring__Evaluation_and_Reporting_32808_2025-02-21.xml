      <p>The  Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) has developed this guidance to help program  officials, policy analysts, evaluators and performance measurement  practitioners improve measurement, evaluation, and reporting by strengthening results activities  through data linking. It includes a step-by-step process for measuring impacts using  this approach. The use of data linking can ensure access to high-quality data to  measure impacts while protecting privacy. </p>
      <p>In particular,  this guidance:</p>

          <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=31306">
            <em>Directive on Results</em>
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          enables departments to support government-wide  reporting of program impacts on gender and diversity as set out in the 
          <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-17.2/FullText.html">
            <em>Canadian Gender Budgeting Act</em>
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>When a  program serves individuals or businesses, TBS recommends that the programâs  enabling authorities be developed to allow for the collection of identifying  data. These identifiers can help link program data to anonymized tax, benefits  or other data managed by Statistics Canada. Departments are strongly encouraged  to explore these avenues prior to seeking authorities for new or existing  programs through budget proposals, memoranda to Cabinet or Treasury Board  submissions. </p>
      <p>
        It is worth  noting that the authority for an institution to implement a program or activity  also includes authority to carry out monitoring and evaluation in most cases. The  authority to collect and use data in accordance with the 
        <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-21/section-8.html">
          <em>Privacy Act</em>
        </a>
         must, however, be confirmed by the  departmental legal services unit.
      </p>
      <p>

    </chapter>
    <chapter anchor="B" title="What is data linking?">
      <p>
        Data linking involves combining administrative program data with other sources of data to enable more detailed analyses than would be possible with just the original data set.
        <sup id="fn1-rf">

        </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        To enable  effective program administration, departments collect program-related data from  individuals or businesses. Statistics Canada also collects other information on  these individuals and businesses, such as income or geographical data, often  from other governmental institutions (for instance, from income tax returns,  immigration records and employment insurance records). In fact, Statistics  Canada may have a lot of information on individuals that, when anonymized to  protect privacy, could allow disaggregation of socio-economic outcomes by  gender and diversity factors. This is essential for effective results  management and also supports reporting under the 
        <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-17.2/FullText.html">
          <em>Canadian Gender Budgeting Act</em>
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Pursuing data linking with Statistics Canada significantly  expands the potential for program analysis of gender and diversity factors while  minimizing the burden of new data collection. As well, through Statistics  Canada, the linking happens in a protected environment (with appropriate  anonymization, which reduces privacy risks). Statistics Canada has various  linkage services, including: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the Social Data Linkage Environment to link data  on individuals</li>
        <li>the Business Linkage File Environment to link  business data</li>
        <li>
          a range of existing linkage platforms (for  example, the 
          <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/statistical-programs/document/5228_D1_V1">Canadian Employer-Employee Dynamics Database</a>
           and the

           and linked databases accessible to federal department partners

        However, a number of steps are required to enable this work.  These steps are provided in

    <chapter anchor="C" title="Considerations">
      <p>
        While this  guidance focuses on how to implement data linking, it also refers to what data  linking can be used for. Indeed, to ensure compliance with sectionÂ 4 of the 
        <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=31306">
          <em>Directive on Results</em>
        </a>
        , impact reporting plans need to be considered  in the early stages of program and policy development. These plans, along with  supporting data activities, are to be developed so that departments are clear on  how they will assess success as set out in sectionÂ 3 of the Treasury Board 
        <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=31300">
          <em>Policy on Results</em>
        </a>
        . To do so, program leads are  encouraged to consult early in the process with departmental leads in data  management, as well as with the departmentâs 
        <strong>Head of Performance Measurement </strong>
        and
        <strong> Head of Evaluation</strong>
        . These latter officials will help define what  data requirements are for the department and for specific programs. Program  officials may also benefit from involving Statistics Canada at this early  stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reporting  on gender and diversity impacts generally involves personal information. Within  their authorities, as set out in sectionÂ 4 of the 
        <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-21/section-8.html">
          <em>Privacy Act</em>
        </a>
        ,  program officials must recognize their responsibility as stewards of Canadiansâ;  personal information and be seen to be good stewards. Program officials must be  clear on what information requirements they have and for what purpose they are  collecting that information. As set out in sectionÂ 4 of the 
        <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=31306">
          <em>Directive on Results</em>
        </a>
        ,  they must update the programâs Performance Information Profile accordingly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the requirements of the 
        <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-21/section-8.html">
          <em>Privacy Act</em>
        </a>
        , it is critically important that programs ensure that they have the  authorities to collect, use and disclose this information. In absence  of this authority, it is recommended that program officials consult with the departmental  legal services unit to assess whether a legislative amendment is required for program impacts reporting. When personal  data are collected solely for monitoring, evaluation and reporting, program  officials are strongly encouraged to communicate this to the individuals from  whom the information is being requested. In other words, in such a scenario, it  should be made clear that the data will not be used for program administration  in respect of any specific individual but rather for the measurement and  evaluation of the whole program.
      </p>
      <p>
        TBS has  prepared a 
        <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information-privacy-notices/2023-02-evaluation.html">Privacy Implementation  Notice</a>
         that provides  further guidance on how to manage personal information for program monitoring,  evaluation and reporting purposes while protecting the personal information of  Canadians. It  includes guidance on the requirements related to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>privacy impact assessments</li>
        <li>privacy protocols</li>
        <li>personal information banks</li>
        <li>privacy notice statements</li>
        <li>information-sharing agreements </li>
        <li>privacy protective techniques</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Program  officials should reach out to their Access to Information and Privacy Offices  for more information on the above.</p>
      <p>
        As  specified in the 
        <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information-privacy-notices/2023-02-evaluation.html">Privacy Implementation  Notice</a>
        , program officials  also need to ensure that they have the agreements necessary to pursue data  linking arrangements with Statistics Canada. Statistics Canada has strict policies,  directives and processes to ensure the effective management of microdata  linkage activities while addressing and mitigating the inherent privacy risks  that linkages can pose.

          <header>
            <h4>3. Develop a monitoring and evaluation data plan</h4>
          </header>
          <p>Before new direct data collection is  considered, the program official should work with its performance measurement or evaluation officials, data office, privacy  officials and Statistics Canada on options for data linking in its secure  linking environments to leverage existing data. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This step may  require a significant amount of time for discussion and approvals. Statistics  Canada operates on a cost-recovery basis. As a result, programs will also need  to budget for linkage activities. To get started, contact Statistics Canada  early in the process (see 
              <a href="#appB">AppendixÂ B</a>
               for contact  information).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Where direct data collection is  necessary, the program should develop a detailed plan to articulate what data  needs to be collected, how it will be collected, when, and from where. Considerations  should also be given to what data could be linked from existing sources, where  disclosure is permitted, to eliminate duplication. Consult with legal services and privacy officials to  determine which provisions of the 
            <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-21/section-8.html">
              <em>Privacy Act</em>
            </a>
            , such as paragraph 8(2)(j) for research and  statistical purposes, can authorize sharing without consent.
          </p>
          <p>To be able to link data, programs need  to collect individual and/or business identifier data. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Particular attention needs to be paid to how  the data will be collected, who will collect it, and what authorities,  agreements, and terms and conditions are required to enable this. Because of the  other parties involved, this is an important consideration for grants and  contributions programs as well as programs providing services to Canadians.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Focus would be on additional data  where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>personal characteristics of clients or applicants  are important for analytical purposes and where they are not available through  Statistics Canada</li>
            <li>details on outcomes that are not available through  Statistics Canada (for example, details pre- and post-benefits)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Programs should first leverage program  data already being collected to analyze program interventions and impacts based  on client eligibility. </p>

          <p>Programs should take stock of  obstacles that the program faces in the implementation of a linking-based data  initiative, including partnership agreements or information technology  limitations. Plans should be developed to address identified obstacles. </p>
          <p>
            
  Any barriers that are systemic or  beyond the organizationâs capacity to address should be referred to TBS at

          <li>with respect to individual Gender-based Analysis  Plus (GBA Plus) characteristics, younger workers, visible minorities, refugees  and Indigenous workers were more likely to have received the CERB than workers  without these characteristics</li>
          <li>
            with respect to intersecting GBA Plus  characteristics: 
  
            <ul>
              <li>generally, women and youth in  visible minority groups were more likely to have received the CERB</li>
              <li>among Black workers, men were  slightly more likely than women to have received the CERB</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>beyond the above, there may  be further areas of analysis that can be explored</li>

          <h4>Question</h4>
        </header>
        <p>
          <strong>Did the Regional Economic Growth Through Innovation (REGI)  program lead the assisted businesses to grow?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
  REGI  provides assistance through two program streams: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>the Business Scale-up and  Productivity Stream (BSP), which provides support to businesses at various  stages of development</li>
          <li>the Regional Innovation Ecosystems  Stream (RIE), which aims toâ¯create, grow and nurture inclusive regional  ecosystems that support business needs and foster an entrepreneurial  environment conducive to innovation, growth and competitiveness</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Did  the businesses that received assistance through the BSP or RIE grow in terms of  employment, revenue and labour productivity? Did they become exporters and/or  did they invest in research and development?</p>
        <header>
          <h4>Data linkage</h4>
        </header>
        <p>REGI program data (list of  businesses assisted by REGI) were linked to the Canadian Employer-Employee  Dynamics Database.</p>
        <header>
          <h4>Results</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Two reports were provided to  the Regional Development Agencies: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Economic Assessment for the REGI  Program (BSP Direct Stream) </li>
          <li>Economic Assessment for the REGI Program (All Streams excluding the BSP Direct  Stream) </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Key results include the following: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>BSP clients have different characteristics  than non-clients. In particular, compared to non-clients, they are larger, they  tend to be more heavily concentrated in the goods sector, and a higher  proportion of them are in Quebec</li>
          <li>clients in general have higher revenue, employment, labour productivity,  export, and research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure growth rates, and  are more likely to become exporters or R&amp;D performers</li>
        </ul>

          <h4>Question</h4>
        </header>
        <p>
          <strong>How did federal  business innovation and growth program streams support official language minority-owned businesses in Canada in 2020?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Official language minority  (OLM)-owned businesses refer to businesses whose owner has English as their  first official language spoken (FOLS) in  Quebec and French as their FOLS in the rest of Canada. </p>
        <header>
          <h4>Data linkage</h4>
        </header>
        <p>The Business-Linkable File Environment and Business  Innovation and Growth Support programs data were linked to the 2021 Census of  Population and Longitudinal Immigration Database.</p>
        <header>
          <h4>Results</h4>
        </header>
        <p>In  2020, around 344,000Â businesses were OLM-owned, representing 6.3% of all  businesses in Canada. Of these businesses, close to 2,000 (0.5%) received $437.6Â million  (12.7%) of total business innovation and growth support funding.</p>
        <p>Compared  with unsupported OLM-owned businesses, supported OLM-owned businesses were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1.9Â times less likely to be owned by women</li>
          <li>4.8Â times more likely to report making at least $2Â million in  revenue</li>
          <li>10.5Â times more concentrated in manufacturing</li>

          <h4>Data linkage</h4>
        </header>
        <p>The Business-Linkable File Environment and Business  Innovation and Growth Support (BIGS) programs data were linked to the 2021  Census of Population and Longitudinal Immigration Database.</p>
        <header>
          <h4>Results</h4>
        </header>
        <p>In 2020, there were an  estimated 145,000Â Black-owned businesses in Canada, representing 2.4% of  the total number of businesses in the country.</p>
        <p>Black-owned  businesses are more likely owned by immigrants, younger people and the self-employed. </p>
        <p>In  2020, close to 1% of federal BIGS went to Black-owned businesses. This  represents approximately $42Â million of the total $3.8Â billion in  federal funding through BIGS.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Majority female-owned small  and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sold 20.9% less in 2011 and 18.4% less in 2014  than majority male-owned SMEs.</p>
        <p>Majority female-owned SMEs  employed 25.1% fewer employees in 2011 and 19.5% fewer employees in 2014 than  majority male-owned SMEs.</p>
        <p>When controlling for  key factors, the assessed risk of debt financing requests by majority female-owned  SMEs was comparable to that of majority male-owned SMEs in 2014.</p>
        <p>Majority female-owned SMEs  had a higher probability of innovating in manufacturing, accommodation and food  services, and retail trade in 2014.</p>
