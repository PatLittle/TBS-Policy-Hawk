            <dd>
              <p>This is the version of the technology that the provider markets, promotes and supports. The provider could be a company that sells a particular technology, a department (for a tool that it has built for itself) or a community that maintains an open-source technology. For in-house applications, this is the version that is used in the production environment and for which most updates, patches and other maintenance efforts are designed. This version is also known as the production version, release-to-manufacture version, general availability release or gold build.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>supported version</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This is the version of the technology that the provider continues to support with updates, patches, fixes and improvements to the product. The provider of the technology has not stopped support. The providerâs product roadmap is used as the authoritative source for determining whether a technology is supported. </p>
              <p>Extended support refers to the situation where the provider of the technology continues to provide updates, patches and fixes at a negotiated, and usually additional, cost. The provider has stopped all commercial support. The providerâs product roadmap is used as the authoritative source for determining whether a technology is supported.</p>
