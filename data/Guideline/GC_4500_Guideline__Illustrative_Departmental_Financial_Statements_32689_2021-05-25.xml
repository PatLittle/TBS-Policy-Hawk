Departments must use their professional judgment to modify the Illustrative DFS to reflect their unique operations and organizational context and to fulfill their specific departmental reporting requirements, provided all relevant PSAS and/or Government of Canada Accounting Handbook (GCAH) reporting requirements are met.</p><p>For all purposes:</p><ul><li>Financial statements that are subject to an external audit will have an auditor’s report appended to them. For departments that are not audited, the financial statements must be annotated “unaudited” on each page;</li><li>The unit of measure used in the DFS must be clearly indicated. The unit of measure used in the notes should be consistent with the unit of measure used in the financial statements;</li><li>The term “the Department” has been used throughout the Illustrative DFS. The name of the entity should replace “the Department” wherever possible; and</li><li>The external reader should readily understand terminology used in the DFS. Government of Canada jargon or acronyms that are not widely understood outside the Canadian federal public service should be avoided and replaced with words that describe their substance.</li></ul></chapter><chapter anchor="B" title="Statement of Management Responsibility Including Internal Control over Financial Reporting"><p>The Statement of Management Responsibility Including Internal Control over Financial Reporting (SMR) is an acknowledgement of management’s responsibility for the preparation of the DFS and other financial information, as well as the external financial reporting process and the departmental system of internal control over financial reporting. The SMR also sets out the role of the board of directors <em>(if applicable)</em> and the departmental audit committee <em>(if applicable)</em> in relation to the external financial reporting process. The SMR must be signed by the Deputy Head and the Chief Financial Officer.</p><section><h3>Structure and Format</h3><p>The SMR must be modified to suit the department’s unique operations and to reflect the departmental context and realities, including variations that may stem from whether the entity is subject to a Core Control Audit by the Office of the Comptroller General.</p><p>The Office of the Comptroller General undertakes Core Control Audits in small departments to facilitate access to professional internal audit resources. For the purpose of adhering to the Treasury Board <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32495">Policy on Financial Management</a>, these organizations are able to use the results of such audits. Core control audits inform deputy heads of their organizations’ level of compliance with key requirements contained in selected financial legislation, policies and directives.</p><p>As a result, two models of the SMR are provided below based on whether or not the organization is subject to Core Control Audits by the Office of the Comptroller General. In relation to the SMR model for departments not subject to a Core Control Audit and who are annexing the summary of results and action plans from the annual risk-based assessment of effectiveness of their internal controls over financial reporting, this annex is to be placed after the financial statement notes as the final component of the Departmental Financial Statement package. In addition, this annex should be titled “Annex to the Statement of Management Responsibility Including Internal Control over Financial Reporting of <em>[Department]</em> for Fiscal Year 20XX-20XX <em>(unaudited)</em>”. Finally, departments are to ensure that each page of this annex is identified as unaudited through a footnote or header.</p><p>The SMR should be dated at the point where all events have been taken into account. The statement should be dated no earlier than the date when all the financial statements, including the related notes, have been prepared and those with the recognized authority have confirmed that they have taken responsibility for those financial statements. The date would normally be as near as practicable to, but not after the date of the auditor’s report <em>(as applicable)</em> with a view to ensuring consistent consideration of subsequent events.</p></section><section><h3>Organizations not subject to Core Control Audits by the Office of the Comptroller General</h3><section><h4>Statement of Management Responsibility Including Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h4><p>Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the accompanying financial statements for the year ended March 31, 20XX, and all information contained in these financial statements rests with the management of the <em>[Department]</em>. These financial statements have been prepared by management using the Government of Canada’s accounting policies, which are based on Canadian public sector accounting standards.</p><p>Management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the information in these financial statements. Some of the information in the financial statements is based on management’s best estimates and judgment, and gives due consideration to materiality. To fulfill its accounting and reporting responsibilities, management maintains a set of accounts that provides a centralized record of the <em>[Department]</em>’s financial transactions. Financial information submitted in the preparation of the Public Accounts of Canada, and included in the<em>[Department]</em>’s <em>Departmental Results Report,</em> is consistent with these financial statements.</p><p>Management is also responsible for maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) designed to provide reasonable assurance that financial information is reliable, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly authorized and recorded in accordance with the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> and other applicable legislation, regulations, authorities and policies.</p><p>Management seeks to ensure the objectivity and integrity of data in its financial statements through careful selection, training and development of qualified staff; through organizational arrangements that provide appropriate divisions of responsibility; through communication programs aimed at ensuring that regulations, policies, standards, and managerial authorities are understood throughout the <em>[Department]</em> and through conducting an annual risk-based assessment of the effectiveness of the system of ICFR.</p><p>The system of ICFR is designed to mitigate risks to a reasonable level based on an ongoing process to identify key risks, to assess effectiveness of associated key controls, and to make any necessary adjustments.

Authority and objectives</h4><p>A brief description of the authority and objectives of the Department must be included here.</p><p>As well, a description of the core responsibilities (or other groupings) of the Department should be included for those that are reported in the Statement of Operations and Departmental Net Financial Position and in the Segmented information note.</p></section><section><h4 id="notes-2">2. Summary of significant accounting policies</h4><p>These financial statements are prepared using the department’s accounting policies stated below, which are based on Canadian public sector accounting standards. The presentation and results using the stated accounting policies do not result in any significant differences from Canadian public sector accounting standards.</p><p>Significant accounting policies are as follows:</p><section><h5 id="notes-2a">(a) Parliamentary authorities</h5><p>The Department is financed by the Government of Canada through Parliamentary authorities. Financial reporting of authorities provided to the Department do not parallel financial reporting according to generally accepted accounting principles since authorities are primarily based on cash flow requirements. Consequently, items recognized in the Statement of Operations and Departmental Net Financial Position and in the Statement of Financial Position are not necessarily the same as those provided through authorities from Parliament. Note 3 provides a reconciliation between the bases of reporting. The planned results amounts in the "Expenses" and "Revenues" sections of the Statement of Operations and Departmental Net Financial Position are the amounts reported in the Future-oriented Statement of Operations included in the 2017-2018 Departmental Plan. Planned results are not presented in the "Government funding and transfers" section of the Statement of Operations and Departmental Net Financial Position and in the Statement of Change in Departmental Net Debt because these amounts were not included in the 2017-2018 Departmental Plan. <em>(Departments including planned results in the ’Government funding and transfers’ section of the Statement of Operations and Departmental Net Financial Position and also in the Statement of Change in Departmental Net Debt, should replace the last sentence with the following: The planned results amounts in the “Government funding and transfers” section of the Statement of Operations and Departmental Net Financial Position and in the Statement of Change in Departmental Net Debt were prepared for internal management purposes and have not been previously published.)</em></p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2b">(b) Consolidation</h5><p>These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the sub-entities for which the deputy head (DH) is accountable for. The accounts of these sub-entities have been consolidated with those of the Department, and all inter-organizational balances and transactions have been eliminated. <em>(Entities that are consolidated in the Department’s financial statements should be listed in this note.)</em></p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2c">(c) Net cash provided by Government</h5><p>The Department operates within the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), which is administered by the Receiver General for Canada. All cash received by the Department is deposited to the CRF, and all cash disbursements made by the Department are paid from the CRF. The net cash provided by Government is the difference between all cash receipts and all cash disbursements, including transactions between departments of the Government.</p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2d">(d) Amounts due from or to the CRF</h5><p>Amounts due from or to the CRF are the result of timing differences at year-end between when a transaction affects authorities and when it is processed through the CRF. Amounts due from the CRF represent the net amount of cash that the Department is entitled to draw from the CRF without further authorities to discharge its liabilities.</p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2e">(e) Revenues</h5><p>Revenues from regulatory fees are recognized based on the services provided in the year. Funds received from external parties for specified purposes are recorded upon receipt as deferred revenue. Revenues are then recognized in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. Deferred revenue consists of amounts received in advance of the delivery of goods and rendering of services that will be recognized as revenue in a subsequent fiscal year as it is earned. Other revenues are recognized in the period the event giving rise to the revenues occurred. Revenues that are non-respendable are not available to discharge the Department’s liabilities. While the DH is expected to maintain accounting control, he or she has no authority regarding the disposition of non-respendable revenues. As a result, non-respendable revenues are considered to be earned on behalf of the Government of Canada and are therefore presented as a reduction of the entity’s gross revenues.</p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2f">(f) Expenses</h5><p>Transfer payments are recorded as an expense in the year the transfer is authorized and all eligibility criteria have been met by the recipient. Vacation pay and compensatory leave are accrued as the benefits are earned by employees under their respective terms of employment. Services provided without charge by other government departments for accommodation, employer contributions to the health and dental insurance plans, legal services and workers’ compensation are recorded as operating expenses at their carrying value. <em>(The department should adapt this note to its own situation.)</em></p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2g">(g) Employee future benefits</h5><section><h6 id="notes-2g-i">i. Pension benefits</h6><p>Eligible employees participate in the Public Service Pension Plan <em>(identify appropriate plan)</em>, a multiemployer pension plan administered by the Government. The Department’s contributions to the Plan are charged to expenses in the year incurred and represent the total departmental obligation to the Plan. The Department’s responsibility with regard to the Plan is limited to its contributions. Actuarial surpluses or deficiencies are recognized in the financial statements of the Government of Canada, as the Plan’s sponsor. <em>(The department should adapt this note to its own situation.)</em></p></section><section><h6 id="notes-2g-ii">ii. Severance benefits</h6><p>The accumulation of severance benefits for voluntary departures ceased for applicable employee groups. The remaining obligation for employees who did not withdraw benefits is calculated using information derived from the results of the actuarially determined liability for employee severance benefits for the Government as a whole.</p></section></section><section><h5 id="notes-2h">(h) Accounts and loans receivable</h5><p>Accounts and loans receivable are initially recorded at cost and where necessary, are discounted to reflect their concessionary terms. Concessionary terms of loans include cases where loans are made on a long-term, low interest or interest-free basis. Transfer payments that are unconditionally repayable are recognized as loans receivable. When necessary, an allowance for valuation is recorded to reduce the carrying value of accounts and loans receivable to amounts that approximate their net recoverable value.</p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2i">(i) Non-financial assets</h5><p>The costs of acquiring land, buildings, equipment and other capital property are capitalized as tangible capital assets and, except for land, are amortized to expense over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as described in Note 12. All tangible capital assets and leasehold improvements having an initial cost of $10,000 <em>(If the department has a different threshold, then this amount should be reflected)</em> or more are recorded at their acquisition cost. Tangible capital assets do not include immovable assets located on reserves as defined in the <em>Indian Act,</em> works of art, museum collection and Crown land to which no acquisition cost is attributable; and intangible assets.</p><p>Inventories are valued at cost and are comprised of spare parts and supplies held for future program delivery and are not primarily intended for resale. Inventories that no longer have service potential are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.</p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2j">(j) Contingent Liabilities</h5><p>Contingent liabilities, including the allowance for guarantees, are potential liabilities which may become actual liabilities when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. If the future event is likely to occur or fail to occur, and a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made, a provision is accrued and an expense recorded to other expenses. If the likelihood is not determinable or an amount cannot be reasonably estimated, the contingency is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.</p><p>For guarantees, an allowance is recorded when it is determined that a loss is likely and the amount of the allowance is estimated taking into consideration the nature of the guarantee, loss experience and current conditions. The allowance is reviewed on an ongoing basis and changes in the allowance are recorded as expenses in the year they become known.</p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2k">(k) Contingent assets</h5><p>Contingent assets are possible assets which may become actual assets when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. If the future even is likely to occur or fail to occur, the contingent asset is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.</p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2l">(l) Environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations</h5><p>An environmental liability for the remediation of contaminated sites is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: an environmental standard exists, contamination exceeds the environmental standard, the Government is directly responsible or accepts responsibility, it is expected that future economic benefits will be given up and a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made. The liability reflects the Government’s best estimate of the amount required to remediate the sites to the current minimum standard for its use prior to contamination. When the future cash flows required to settle or otherwise extinguish a liability are estimable, predictable and expected to occur over extended future periods, a present value technique is used. The discount rate used reflects the Government’s cost of borrowing, associated with the estimated number of years to complete remediation.</p><p>A liability for unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) affected legacy sites is recognized when there is an appropriate basis for measurement and a reasonable estimate can be made. These liabilities are present obligations arising from past transactions or events, the settlement of which is expected to result in the future sacrifice of economic benefits. <em>(if applicable)</em></p><p>Asset retirement obligations are the Government’s best estimate of costs related to obligations associated with the retirement of tangible capital assets. A liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: there is an agreement, contract, legislation, or a constructive or equitable obligation that obligates the Government to incur retirement costs in relation to a tangible capital asset, the past event or transaction giving rise to the retirement liability has occurred, it is expected that future economic benefits will be given up and a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made. These costs are normally capitalized and amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. If the related asset is fully amortized, the asset retirement costs are expensed. The liability reflects the present value of estimated future cash flows required to retire the assets where amounts can be reasonably estimated and is expected to be settled as the related sites, facilities or assets are removed from service. The estimated future cash flows are adjusted for inflation using a rate that is derived on the basis of Consensus forecasts and Bank of Canada historical and target inflation rates. The discount rate is a weighted average rate reflecting the Government’s cost of borrowing on initial recognition and on subsequent changes to expected cash flows, which is most closely associated with the period to settlement of the obligation. <em>(if applicable)</em></p><p>The recorded liabilities are adjusted each year, for present value adjustments, inflation, new obligations, changes in management estimates and actual costs incurred.</p><p>If the likelihood of the Government’s responsibility is not determinable, a contingent liability is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated statements.</p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2m">(m) Transactions involving foreign currencies</h5><p>Transactions involving foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollar equivalents using rates of exchange in effect at the time of those transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated in Canadian dollars using the rate of exchange in effect at March 31st. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are reported on the Statement of Operations and Departmental Net Financial Position according to the activities to which they relate. Net gains and losses relating to [specify the item] are included in [specific the line]. <em>(This note is not required when the department does not have significant foreign exchange transactions.)</em></p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2n">(n) Measurement uncertainty</h5><p>The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes at March 31. The estimates are based on facts and circumstances, historical experience, general economic conditions and reflect the Government’s best estimate of the related amount at the end of the reporting period. The most significant items where estimates are used are contingent liabilities, environmental liabilities, the liability for employee future benefits and the useful life of tangible capital assets (list as applicable). Actual results could significantly differ from those estimated. Management’s estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are recorded in the financial statements in the year they become known. <em>(This note should be enhanced if a department has a particular significant measurement uncertainty, for example environmental liabilities below.)</em></p><p>Environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations are subject to measurement uncertainty as discussed in Note 5 due to the evolving technologies used in the estimation of the costs for remediation of contaminated sites or asset retirements, the use of discounted present value of future estimated costs, and the fact that not all sites have had a complete assessment of the extent and nature of remediation or asset retirement costs. Changes to underlying assumptions, the timing of the expenditures, the technology employed, or the revisions to environmental standards or changes in regulatory requirements could result in significant changes to the environmental liabilities recorded. <em>(This note should be included when measurement uncertainty for Environmental Liabilities is significant)</em></p></section><section><h5 id="notes-2o">(o) Related party transactions</h5><p>Related party transactions, other than inter-entity transactions, are recorded at the exchange amount.</p><p>Inter-entity transactions are transactions between commonly controlled entities. Inter-entity transactions, other than restructuring transactions, are recorded on a gross basis and are measured at the carrying amount, except for the following:</p><ol class="lst-lwr-rmn"><li>Services provided on a recovery basis are recognized as revenues and expenses on a gross basis and measured at the exchange amount.</li><li>Certain services received on a without charge basis are recorded for departmental financial statement purposes at the carrying amount.</li></ol></section><aside class="wb-fnote mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-lg"><h5>Explanatory Notes:</h5><p>Departments should not include accounting policy notes that are not relevant to their operations.</p></aside></section><section><h4 id="notes-3">3. Parliamentary authorities</h4><p>The Department receives most of its funding through annual parliamentary authorities. Items recognized in the Statement of Operations and Departmental Net Financial Position and the Statement of Financial Position in one year may be funded through parliamentary authorities in prior, current or future years. Accordingly, the Department has different net results of operations for the year on a government funding basis than on an accrual accounting basis. The differences are reconciled in the following tables:</p><section><h5 id="notes-3a">(a) Reconciliation of net cost of operations to current year authorities used</h5><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-hover small"><caption class="text-left"><span class="wb-inv">Reconciliation of net cost of operations to current year authorities used<br /></span> (in thousands of dollars)

Under this approach the Government has inventoried the contaminated sites identified on federal lands, allowing them to be classified, managed and recorded in a consistent manner. This systematic approach aids in identification of the high risk sites in order to allocate limited resources to those sites which pose the highest risk to human health and the environment.</p><p>The Department has identified approximately 530 sites (610 sites in 2017) where contamination may exist and assessment, remediation and monitoring may be required. Of these, the Department has identified approximately 400 sites (425 sites in 2017) where action is required and for which a gross liability of $35,000 thousand ($49,000 thousand in 2017) has been recorded. This liability estimate has been determined based on site assessments performed by environmental experts.</p><section><p><strong><em>(For departments that use the Golder model)</em></strong></p><p>In addition, a statistical model based upon a projection of the number of sites that will proceed to remediation and upon which current and historical costs are applied is used to estimate the liability for a group of unassessed sites. As a result, there are approximately 35 unassessed sites (30 sites in 2017) where a liability estimate of $2,797 thousand ($1,049 thousand in 2017) has been recorded using this model.</p></section><p><strong class="text-uppercase">OR</strong></p><section><p><strong><em>(For departments that do not use the Golder model)</em></strong></p><p>In addition, there are approximately 35 sites that have not been assessed by environmental experts? (30 sites in 2017) for which the department has estimated and recorded a liability of $2,797 thousand ($1,049 thousand in 2017).</p></section><p>These two estimates combined, totalling $37,797 thousand ($50,049 thousand in 2017), represents management’s best estimate of the costs required to remediate sites to the current minimum standard for its use prior to contamination, based on information available at the financial statement date.</p><p>For the remaining 95 sites (155 sites in 2017), no liability for remediation has been recognized. Some of these sites are at various stages of testing and evaluation and if remediation is required, liabilities will be reported as soon as a reasonable estimate can be determined. For other sites, the Department does not expect to give up any future economic benefits (there is likely no significant environmental impact or human health threats). These sites will be re-examined and a liability for remediation will be recognized if future economic benefits will be given up.</p><p>The following table presents the total estimated amounts of these liabilities by nature and source, the associated expected recoveries and the total undiscounted future expenditures as at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017. When the liability estimate is based on a future cash requirement, the amount is adjusted for inflation using a forecast CPI rate of 1.9% (2% in 2017). Inflation is included in the undiscounted amount. The Government of Canada’s cost of borrowing by reference to the actual zero-coupon yield curve for Government of Canada bonds has been used to discount the estimated future expenditures. The March 2018 rates range from 1.79% (0.76% in 2017) for 2 year term to 2.24% (2.39% in 2017) for a 30 or greater year term.</p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-hover small"><caption class="text-left">

Employee future benefits</h4><section><h5 id="notes-8a">(a) Pension benefits</h5><p>The Department’s employees participate in the Public Service Pension Plan (the "Plan"), which is sponsored and administered by the Government of Canada. Pension benefits accrue up to a maximum period of 35 years at a rate of 2 percent per year of pensionable service, times the average of the best five consecutive years of earnings. The benefits are integrated with Canada/Québec Pension Plan benefits and they are indexed to inflation.</p><p>Both the employees and the Department contribute to the cost of the Plan. Due to the amendment of the Public Service Superannuation Act following the implementation of provisions related to Economic Action Plan 2012, employee contributors have been divided into two groups - Group 1 related to existing plan members as of December 31, 2012 and Group 2 relates to members joining the Plan as of January 1, 2013. Each group has a distinct contribution rate.</p><p>The 2017-18 expense amounts to $41,300 thousand ($40,055 thousand in 2016-2017). For Group 1 members, the expense represents approximately 1.01 times (1.12 times in 2016-2017) the employee contributions and, for Group 2 members, approximately 1.00 times (1.08 times in 2016-2017) the employee contributions.</p><p>The Department’s responsibility with regard to the Plan is limited to its contributions.

However, since 2011 the accumulation of severance benefits for voluntary departures progressively ceased for substantially all employees. Employees subject to these changes were given the option to be paid the full or partial value of benefits earned to date or collect the full or remaining value of benefits upon departure from the public service. By March 31, 2018, substantially all settlements for immediate cash out were completed. Severance benefits are unfunded and, consequently, the outstanding obligation will be paid from future authorities.</p><p>The changes in the obligations during the year were as follows:</p><table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-hover small"><caption class="text-left">

They are grouped into three categories (if applicable) as follows:</p><section><h6>Claims and litigation</h6><p>Claims have been made against the Department in the normal course of operations. These claims include items with pleading amounts and other for which no amount is specified. While the total amount claimed in these actions is significant, their outcomes are not determinable. The Department has recorded an allowance for claims and litigations where it is likely that there will be a future payment and a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made. For claims where the estimate of loss is based on a range of possible outcomes and the amount accrued was less than the maximum of the range, the exposure to liability in excess of the amount accrued is estimated at $15 thousand. Claims and litigations for which the outcome is not determinable and a reasonable estimate can be made by management amount to approximately $20,000 thousand ($14,000 thousand in 2016-2017) at March 31, 2018.

Repayments are determined by a project’s profitability, and have a maximum repayment period of 20 years. The final payment is due no later than 2025.</p><p>As these are conditionally repayable contributions, the amounts that will become repayable cannot be currently estimated as contribution agreements are subject to specific program requirements, which require annual determinations as to the value which must be repaid each year. Thus, to forecast a specific amount repayable each year is not possible due to the varying factors facing each recipient as it relates to their economic and production performances.</p></section><aside class="wb-fnote mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-lg"><h5>Explanatory Notes:</h5><p>The department should provide details of significant cases.

Significance is assessed based on the departmental materiality policy without consideration for Public Accounts materiality levels. Contingent Liabilities with related parties (as defined in PS 2200) require separate disclosure from other contingent liabilities only when they have occurred at a value different from that which would have been arrived at if the parties were unrelated and have or could have a material financial effect on the financial statements. Refer to GC 2200/PS2200 Related party disclosures for additional information.</p><p>Contingent liability disclosure for environmental liabilities is related to the uncertainty of whether or not the department is responsible for remediating a contaminated site. The department may have assessed that it is not directly responsible for the site and therefore does not accept responsibility. However, there could still be uncertainty as to whether the department may be held responsible at some point in the future.
