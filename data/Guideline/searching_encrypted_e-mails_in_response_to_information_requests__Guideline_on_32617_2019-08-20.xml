In this case, since we want to look for encrypted e-mails, you will need to create a custom search folder for encrypted e-mails. </p><ol class="lst-spcd"><li>To create a custom search folder, open Microsoft Outlook, select the <strong>Folder</strong> tab on the ribbon, and then click on the <strong>New Search Folder</strong> button.
