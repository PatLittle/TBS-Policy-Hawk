        By default, the Contractor is to  own the ForegroundÂ IPÂ arising under Crown Procurement Contracts,  unless the Crown claims one of the exceptions listed below, or applies for  aÂ TBÂ exemption from this Policy through aÂ TBÂ Submission.  Under the Crown Procurement Contract, the Crown may claim ownership of the  ForegroundÂ IPÂ for the following reasons (please seeÂ

        <li>Where statutes, regulations or prior obligations of the Crown to a third party or parties preclude Contractor ownership of the ForegroundÂ IP.</li>

            <li>4.1 To generate knowledge and information for public dissemination.</li>
            <li>4.2 To augment an existing body of Crown Background as a prerequisite to the transfer of the expanded Background to the private sector, through licensing or assignment of ownership (not necessarily to the original contractor), for the purposes of Commercial Exploitation.</li>
            <li>4.3 To deliver a not-yet fully developed component or subsystem that will be incorporated into a complete system at a later date, as a prerequisite to the planned transfer of the complete system to the private sector, through licensing  or assignment of ownership, for the purposes of Commercial Exploitation.</li>

      <p>The Crown may take ownership of Intellectual Property in circumstances  where it is justified but not provided for in one of the exceptions listed above,  and the Responsible Department has, in collaboration with the Contracting  Department, sought and obtained Treasury Board approval for such an exemption.  Prior to seeking an exemption, it is important to consider whether  ForegroundÂ IPÂ ownership is necessary, or if a license would suffice.</p>

    <appendix anchor="B" title="Appendix B â Licensing Intellectual Property">
      <p>
        Contractor ownership of  ForegroundÂ IPÂ does not preclude the Crown from using the  ForegroundÂ IP, provided that the Crown obtains a royalty-free licence to  have the right to use, or have used by a third party, the  ForegroundÂ IPÂ owned by the Contractor. The contractor shall be  required to obtain from its subcontractors those ownership or licence rights  that the Contractor agrees, in the Crown Procurement Contract, to provide to  the Crown. Examples of the licensing provisions for such situations can be  found in the Model Clauses (

        <strong>Contractor Owned Intellectual Property</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When the Contractor takes ownership of the ForegroundÂ IP, the Policy allows the Crown to require the Contractor to provide it with a royalty-free license to exercise allÂ IPÂ rights in the Foreground for government activities except commercial exploitation.</li>
        <li>The Crown may require the Contractor to carry out commercial exploitation of the ForegroundÂ IPÂ in Canada and/or within a specific period of time, to the extent that the requirement is consistent with Canada's trade agreement obligations. The detailed requirements can be specified in the contract or in a separate agreement between the Crown and the Contractor.</li>

        <strong>Crown Owned Intellectual Property</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When the Crown takes ownership of the ForegroundÂ IPÂ through the use of exceptions in SectionsÂ 4.2 or 4.3, any ForegroundÂ IPÂ licence the Crown grants a Contractor, other than a licence to the final completed product, must be royalty-free. When the Crown takes ownership through the use of any other exception, the Crown may require royalties for the licence.</li>
        <li>When the Contractor requires the use of the Crown's ForegroundÂ IP, the Contractor has 30Â working days to make a request in writing for the licence, following contract completion. The Crown may also grant a licence to the  Contractor for the Contractor's use of the Crown's BackgroundÂ IP. While the Crown has the right to refuse such requests, it must provide an       explanation in writing for the refusal within a reasonable period of time.</li>
