          In the  Government of Canada, evaluation is the systematic collection and analysis of  information about the outcomes of transfer payment programs. The information is  used to make judgments about a transfer payment programâs relevance, results  and cost-effectiveness, and to find alternative ways to deliver the transfer  payment program or to achieve the same results. SectionÂ 42.1 of the 
          <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">
            <em>Financial Administration Act</em>
          </a>
           requires that every department conduct a review every  five years of the relevance and effectiveness of each ongoing non-statutory  program of grants and contributions. This review is a form of evaluation that  would be conducted in a manner appropriate for the risk, complexity and  materiality of the program.
