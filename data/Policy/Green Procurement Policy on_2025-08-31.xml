Effective date</h2><div class="pol-content"><p>This policy is effective as of April 1, 2006 and incorporates changes effective as of May 14, 2018.</p></div></section><section class="pol-sec"><h2 id="cha3">3. Application</h2><div class="pol-content"><p>The policy applies to all departments within the meaning of section 2 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial Administration Act</a>, unless specific acts or regulations override it.</p></div></section><section class="pol-sec"><h2 id="cha4">4. Context</h2><div class="pol-content"><p>The federal  government is a significant purchaser in Canada. As such, its activities impact  the national economy and can influence both the price and the availability of  goods and services, including construction services, in the marketplace.  Through the increased promotion of environmental sustainability, and by  integrating environmental considerations in its procurement process, the  federal government is in a position to influence the demand for environmentally  preferable goods and services, the ability of industry to respond to the  escalating use of environmental standards in global markets, and the resiliency of Canadian assets to climate change.</p><p>As part of its  ongoing commitment to improve the environment and the quality of life of  Canadians, this policy seeks to reduce the environmental impacts of government  operations, promote environmental stewardship, and adapt to climate change by integrating environmental considerations in the procurement process.</p><p>Green procurement  is set within the context of achieving value for money. It requires the  integration of environmental considerations into the procurement process  including planning, acquisition, use and disposal. In this context, value for  money includes the consideration of many factors such as cost, performance,  availability, quality and environmental performance. Green procurement also  requires an understanding of the whole lifecycle of goods and services being  acquired from resource extraction through to disposal, including the total cost  of ownership, the relevant risks and opportunities, the environmental and  economic costs or benefits to society, and any environmental or economic  non-monetized positive or negative impacts to society. In addition, the  supporting administrative processes and procurement methods can also offer  opportunities to reduce the environmental impacts of government operations. </p><p>This policy is  issued pursuant to section 7 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial Administration Act</a>, the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-38.2/">Department of Public Works and Government Services  Act</a>, section 4 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-10/">Department of the Environment Act</a> and section 5 and 6 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-20.8/">Department of Natural Resources Act</a>.</p><p>The policy also  supports the federal government in targeting specific environmental outcomes  where procurement can effectively be used to mitigate the impact of – or adapt  to – environmental issues such as climate change and can support the protection  of biodiversity, natural areas, air, soil and water. Where decisions are made  to move forward on realizing specific environmental outcomes through  procurement, it is expected this will:</p><ul><li>demonstrate environmental leadership and influence industry and citizens to use environmentally preferable and  climate-resilient goods, services and processes;</li><li>stimulate innovation and market development of, and demand for, environmentally preferred goods and services, making these available and mainstream for other sectors of society; and</li><li>support emerging environmental technologies.</li></ul></div></section><section class="pol-sec"><h2 id="cha5">5. Definitions</h2><div class="pol-content"><p>Environmentally  preferable goods and services are those that have a lesser or reduced impact on  the environment over the life cycle of the good or service, when compared with  competing goods or services serving the same purpose. Environmental considerations  include, among other things: the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air  contaminants; improved energy and water efficiency; reduced waste and support  reuse and recycling; the use of renewable resources; reduced hazardous waste; reduced  toxic and hazardous substances; and biodiversity. </p></div></section><section class="pol-sec"><h2 id="cha6">6.
