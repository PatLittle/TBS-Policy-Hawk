The various reporting instruments are described in <a href="#appA">Appendix A</a>.</p><p>This process can take a complete reporting cycle leading to the required Governor in Council approval. The steps to follow in order to reach final approval are the following:</p><ol><li>Departments and agencies contact their TBS Results Division analyst to discuss their requests for TBS to examine the potential streamlining of statutory annual reports. The applicant shall provide the most recent version of the report to be discontinued and shall confirm the statutory provision(s) that establish the reporting requirement. TBS Results Division will inform TBS Program Sector and TBS Regulatory Affairs Sector of the request.</li><li>The TBS Results Division reviews the information in the Estimates documents or Public Accounts and in the statutory report in order to ensure that there is no loss of information to Parliament. The outcome of this review will be communicated in writing to the TBS Program Sector and to the TBS Regulatory Affairs Sector, under the approval of the Assistant Secretary of the Expenditure Management Sector.</li><li>The TBS Results Division will communicate the outcome of the review to the department via a letter from the Expenditure Management Sector Assistant Secretary to their counterpart in the department requesting the potential streamlining.</li></ol><p>If the TBS review is favourable, departments and agencies must contact their TBS Regulatory Affairs analyst to discuss the preparation of a Governor in Council submission through which the minister responsible for the department or agency would recommend that an order-in-council be made to discontinue the statutory report. The Expenditure Management Sector confirmation letter should be included as an annex to the submission. Guidance on preparing the submission can be found in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/services/orders-in-council/process-guide-governor-council-submissions.html"><em>Process Guide for Governor in Council Submissions (Other than Regulations)</em></a>.</p><p>If the statutory information is not already in the Estimates documents or the Public Accounts, organizations could consider the following process during a first cycle for potential discontinuance of the report in a subsequent cycle:</p><ol><li>The statutory report to be eliminated or integrated should be adjusted or edited to take out information inconsistent with its defined purpose and scope.</li><li>When such information is of public relations or communications value, it could be published in alternative non-statutory publications such as an annual review, a departmental newsletter, a news release and so on.</li><li>Suitable information would be transferred to the Estimates Part III documents or Public Accounts and also retained in the report to be eliminated.</li></ol><p>The streamlining of a statutory annual report can be initiated at any time during the year.</p><p>The department or agency must continue to produce the annual report until the Governor in Council has approved discontinuance of the statutory report by order-in-council.</p></div></section><section class="pol-sec"><h2 id="cha5">Consolidated reports</h2><div class="pol-content"><p>Some departments and agencies have consolidated statutory reports in their Estimates documents or Public Accounts (see <a href="#appB">Appendix B</a>).

Part I provides an overview of federal spending and summarizes the relationship of the key elements of the Main Estimates to the current Expense Plan. Part II directly supports the Appropriation Act. The Main Estimates identify the spending authorities (Votes) and amounts to be included in subsequent appropriation bills. Part III is divided into two components: the Departmental Plans and the Departmental Results Reports.</p></div></section><section class="pol-sub"><h3 id="secA.2">Public Accounts</h3><div class="pol-content"><p>This is the report of the Government of Canada prepared each fiscal year by the Receiver General as required by section 64 of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>. Public Accounts provide a detailed accounting of government expenditures in relation to Estimates previously voted by Parliament.</p></div></section><section class="pol-sub"><h3 id="secA.3">Departmental Annual Report</h3><div class="pol-content"><p>A Departmental Annual Report is a report on operations for the most recently completed fiscal year that a minister is required, by the department’s enabling statute, to table before Parliament at a designated time.</p><p>As a rule, legislation does not specify content requirements for Departmental Annual Reports; however, the focus of the Departmental Annual Report should be a concise, factual account of the institution’s work during the subject year and the results achieved. Promotional material and matters of local interest should be excluded.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p><p>This interpretation reflects the same results orientation as Part III of the Estimates.</p></div></section><section class="pol-sub"><h3 id="secA.4">Other statutory reports</h3><div class="pol-content"><p>Other statutory reports for specific elements of a department’s operations, or for boards, commissions and so on that have not been created as separate departments, may also be required to be tabled by the same minister. The focus is on specific legislative requirements.</p></div></section><section class="pol-sub"><h3 id="secA.5">Other annual reports</h3><div class="pol-content"><p>Non-statutory annual reports are published at a department’s discretion and cannot be substituted for statutory reports, nor can they be combined with an annual report. The focus of other annual reports is usually the information needs of special or general client groups. They may also contain information of a local or public relations nature.</p><p>Departments or agencies wishing to streamline their Departmental Annual Reports to better reflect the intended purpose of these publications can transfer promotional information to a non-statutory annual report.</p></div></section></div></section><section class="pol-sec"><h2 id="appB">Appendix B - List of Discontinued Reports</h2><div class="pol-content"><p>The following statutory reports have been discontinued.
