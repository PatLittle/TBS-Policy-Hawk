# Directive on the Management of Projects and Programmes

## Note to reader

Appendices F, G and H set out the authorities that are required from Treasury Board with respect to managing a programme. The content of the appendices has been developed based on international best practices and in consultation with pathfinder programmes in the Government of Canada context. Given that programme management is new to the Government of Canada, these appendices are a first iteration and may be revised to incorporate lessons from the management of different types of programmes across the government.

## Appendix C: Project Approval Limits

In exercising oversight, the Treasury Board limits the expenditure authority exercised by ministers in the approval of projects.

All departments and agencies subject to this directive have a base project approval authority limit of $2.5 million (inclusive of the Goods and Services Tax and the Harmonized Sales Tax).

The basis for determining the capacity to manage projects, and seeking an increase to this base amount, is provided in the *Mandatory Procedures for Organizational Project Management Capacity*. Once approved by Treasury Board, the Organizational Project Management Capacity Class establishes a minister’s project approval authority limit.

Departments without an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class or an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 0 are to seek the approval of Treasury Board for all projects over $2.5 million (inclusive of the Goods and Services Tax and the Harmonized Sales Tax).

For departments with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 1 or higher, the basis for the determination of the appropriate approval authority is the relationship between the approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of the department and the assessed Project Complexity and Risk Level of the project. Treasury Board may require any project to be brought forward for their consideration and approval.

The threshold for completing a PCRA is as follows:

* $2.5 million for departments without an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class or with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 0,
* $5 million for departments with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 1,
* $10 million for departments with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 2,
* $25 million for departments with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 3, and
* $50 million for departments with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 4.

The results of the PCRA will confirm the approval authority and inform the planning, resourcing, governance and management of the project.

Ministerial project approval authority limits

| Organizational Project Management Capacity Class | Project complexity and risk level |
| --- | --- |
| Base (unassessed) or Class 0 | $2.5 million |
| Class 1 | Level 1 |
| Class 2 | Level 2   Level 1 |
| Class 3 | Level 3  Level 2  Level 1 |
| Class 4 | Level 4  Level 3  Level 2  Level 1 |

## Appendix D: Project Approval and Expenditure Authority

* D.1

  Projects within a minister’s project approval authority limit

  All projects within a minister’s project approval authority limit must be supported by a business case and require documented project approval. This approval is to be sought in accordance with the processes prescribed within the departmental project and programme management framework, which should include costing standards throughout the lifecycle of a project.
* D.2

  Projects exceeding a minister’s project approval authority limit

  Projects exceeding a minister’s project approval authority limit must be approved by Treasury Board and require two distinct and explicit approvals: project approval and project expenditure authority.

  + In providing project approval, Treasury Board agrees that a requirement has been identified and that there is adequate justification for meeting that requirement through the proposed project. Once granted, project approval will establish a distinct project baseline.
    - For PCRA Level 1, 2, and 3 projects a request for project approval must be supported by an indicative cost estimate.
    - For PCRA Level 4 projects, a request for project approval must be supported by the highest cost estimate credibility possible, and not lower than a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate.
  + Project expenditure authority is the authority to expend funds against project-related activities for which the authority was sought. Project expenditure authority granted by Treasury Board indicates that sufficient information is available, at an appropriate level of detail, to proceed with a set of planned activities within a project phase or phases.
    - For PCRA Level 1, 2, and 3 projects a request for project expenditure authority must be supported by a substantive cost estimate.
    - For PCRA Level 4 projects, a request for project expenditure authority must be supported by the highest cost estimate credibility possible, and not lower than an indicative cost estimate.

  Departments must seek project approval and project expenditure authority from Treasury Board in accordance with the following instructions.

  + D.2.1

    Project definition

    Departments must seek project expenditure authority in order to commence project definition activities. Project approval from the Treasury Board is not required at this stage of the project.

    - Prior to receiving project expenditure authority approval from Treasury Board for project definition activities, the responsible ministers’ authority is limited to those activities necessary to seek this approval such as options analysis, feasibility studies, socio-economic studies, technical investigations, market analysis, topographic surveys, and pricing and availability studies. These activities are commonly referred to as pre-definition activities.
  + D.2.2

    Project implementation

    Departments must seek both project approval and project expenditure authority in order to commence project implementation activities.
  + D.2.3

    Amendments

    Amended project approval and/or project expenditure authority must be sought from Treasury Board when:

    - the total estimated cost changes such that it exceeds the expenditure authority approved by Treasury Board, or
    - there is a significant change to the anticipated outcomes and benefits identified at time of approval, or
    - there has been a significant change to the project baseline established at time of approval.

    When it is clear that one or more of the above conditions will be realized, departments must initiate in a timely fashion, the process of seeking amended approval and/or authorities.
  + D.2.4

    Project submission documentation requirements

    Requests for project approval, project expenditure authority, or amendments to project approval must be supported by the following documentation:

    - Appended to the submission:

      * the Project Brief (including the project cost and an estimate of associated life-cycle costs) developed in accordance with Appendix E
    - The following documents (or their equivalent(s)) may be requested by TBS at the same time as the draft submission:

      * Business Case
      * Project Management Plan
      * Project Gating Plan
      * Procurement Plan
      * Appointment Letter (where applicable)
      * Project Charter
    - An updated Project Brief and/or other plans or documents may also be requested by TBS as and when required.

### Associated authorities

In cases where projects also include real property transactions and/or contracting activities which also require Treasury Board approval, departments are encouraged to coordinate all required approvals (project, real property and procurement) to provide a consolidated view to Treasury Board ministers and in doing so, minimize the number of submissions.

## Appendix E: Project Brief

## Appendix F: Programme Approval and Expenditure Authority

### F.1 Programme confirmation

* F.1.1The process for programme approval is reserved for large business-transformation initiatives.
* F.1.2Before seeking programme approval, departments must confirm with the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) that the investment under consideration constitutes a large business-transformation initiative that should be managed under the process for programme approval and that the organization is ready to undertake the initiative using a programme-management approach.
* F.1.3The investment under consideration will be screened in collaboration with TBS, and the results will inform the determination by TBS of whether an initiative will be managed under the process for programme approval.
* F.1.4Departments must also provide evidence that their deputy head-approved departmental programme-management framework is in place with the required governance.

### F.2 Programme approval and expenditure authority

* F.2.1

  All programmes require two distinct and explicit approvals from Treasury Board – programme approval and expenditure authority – which are described below:

  + F.2.1.1In providing programme approval, the Treasury Board agrees that a large business-transformation initiative has been identified with sufficient complexity and interdependencies to warrant setting up a programme;
  + F.2.1.2Programme approval provides authorization to seek expenditure authority, but it does not, in and of itself, convey authority to expend funds on the programme;
  + F.2.1.3Expenditure authority provides the authority to expend funds against the activities for which the authority was sought; and
  + F.2.1.4Expenditure authority granted by Treasury Board indicates that sufficient information is available, at an appropriate level of detail, to justify the expenditure of funds on a particular phase or tranche of the programme.
* F.2.2Before receiving programme approval from Treasury Board, the sponsoring minister’s authority is limited to the activities necessary to seek the initial programme approval and expenditure authority in support of the definition phase.
* F.2.3Before programme approval, the use of proofs of concept, prototypes and pilots are to be limited to the activities necessary to seek the initial programme approval and expenditure authority in support of the definition phase.
* F.2.4Departments will need to seek the agreement of TBS in order to proceed with a pilot before programme approval.

### F.3 Standard programme submission approach

**Submission for programme approval and expenditure authority for the definition phase**

* F.3.1

  Following the conclusion of the initial planning and identification phase, the sponsoring minister for a programme will seek:

  + F.3.1.1Programme approval for the programme, as well as expenditure authority for the definition phase; and
  + F.3.1.2As appropriate, a separate expenditure authority to advance implementation activities.
* F.3.2The request for programme approval must be supported by the highest cost estimate credibility possible, and not lower than a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate.
* F.3.3The request for expenditure authority in support of the definition phase must be supported by the highest cost estimate credibility possible, and not lower than an indicative cost estimate.
* F.3.4

  This submission for programme approval and expenditure authority for the definition phase must be supported by the following documentation:

  + F.3.4.1

    Appended to the submission:

    - Programme brief for definition
  + F.3.4.2

    Provided to TBS in support of the submission:

    - Appointment letter for the programme sponsor
  + F.3.4.3Other plans or documents may be requested by TBS, as and when required, to support the submission process.
* F.3.5Once granted, programme approval will establish an agreed upon programme baseline.

**Subsequent submissions**

* F.3.6Following completion of the definition phase, the projects and activities that comprise the programme will be grouped into tranches.
* F.3.7

  Each tranche will be the subject of a separate submission with the sponsoring minister, and each submission will:

  + F.3.7.1Update the programme baseline;
  + F.3.7.2Seek expenditure authority for the tranche;
  + F.3.7.3As appropriate, seek authority to approve projects within the tranche that exceed the limits set out in Appendix C: Project Approval Limits of the *Directive on the Management of Projects and Programmes*; and
  + F.3.7.4As appropriate, seek associated real property and contracting authorities in keeping with subsection F.7.1.
* F.3.8The updated programme baseline must be supported by the highest cost estimate credibility possible, and not lower than a ROM cost estimate.
* F.3.9The request for expenditure authority in support of a tranche must be supported by the highest cost estimate credibility possible, and not lower than an indicative cost estimate.
* F.3.10

  Submissions requesting expenditure authority in support of a tranche must be supported by the following documentation:

  + F.3.10.1

    Appended to the submission:

    - Programme brief for implementation (tranche)
  + F.3.10.2

    Provided to TBS in support of the submission:

    - Programme business case
    - Programme target operating model (or equivalent)
    - Programme plan (or equivalent)
    - Projects dossier (or equivalent)
  + F.3.10.3Other plans or documents may be requested by TBS, as and when required.
* F.3.11Once granted, expenditure authority will establish an agreed upon baseline for the programme phase or tranche.

### F.4 Amended programme approval

* F.4.1

  Amended authority in terms of programme approval must be sought from Treasury Board when:

  + F.4.1.1The total estimated cost of the programme changes such that it exceeds the estimate approved by the Treasury Board as part of the most recent programme approval; or
  + F.4.1.2There will be significant change to the programme baseline (capabilities, outcomes and benefits) established through the most recent programme approval.

### F.5 Amended expenditure authority

* F.5.1

  Amended authority in terms of expenditure must be sought from Treasury Board when:

  + F.5.1.1The total estimated cost changes such that it exceeds the expenditure limit (expenditure authority) approved by the Treasury Board; or
  + F.5.1.2There is significant change to the deliverables in terms of capabilities, outcomes and benefits established as part of the expenditure authority.
* F.5.2When it is clear that amended authorities are required, departments must initiate the process of seeking amended authorities in a timely fashion before the existing authority is exceeded or changes to the baseline are introduced.

### F.6 Programme tranche

**Expenditure authority**

* F.6.1The expenditure authority for a tranche sets an expenditure ceiling for the realization of the capabilities and outcomes linked to the tranche. The combined costs of the projects and activities within the tranche cannot exceed this ceiling.
* F.6.2The expenditure authority for a tranche may only be allocated to the projects and programme activities required to deliver the capabilities identified in the submission, and to undertake the planning of the next tranche.

**Projects within a tranche**

* F.6.3The projects within a tranche are not approved by Treasury Board as part of the submission.
* F.6.4

  Subject to the appropriate governance and approvals, changes can be made to the projects that make up a tranche as long as:

  + F.6.4.1The underlying tranche capability is delivered; and
  + F.6.4.2The total cost of the tranche does not exceed the expenditure authority approved by the Treasury Board.

**Projects within a tranche where the Project Complexity and Risk Assessment (PCRA) level is within the Organizational Project Management Capacity (OPMC) class**

* F.6.5Projects where the PCRA level is within the approved departmental OPMC class are to be approved and managed in keeping with the requirements set out in the *Policy on the Planning and Management of Investments* and the *Directive on the Management of Projects and Programmes*.

**Projects within a tranche where the PCRA level exceeds the OPMC class**

* F.6.6

  If a tranche includes or may include projects where the PCRA will exceed the approved departmental OPMC class, the sponsoring minister may choose to seek authority to approve these projects:

  + F.6.6.1This request must be supported by information that demonstrates that the programme has taken the necessary steps to put in place the capacity to manage projects that exceed the approved departmental OPMC class;
  + F.6.6.2This authority is only for the projects related to the tranche for which it is sought and is not transferable. The sponsoring minister must seek this authority for each tranche; and
  + F.6.6.3Projects approved under this authority are to be approved and managed in keeping with the requirements set out in the *Policy on the Planning and Management of Investments* and the *Directive on the Management of Projects and Programmes*.
* F.6.7If the sponsoring minister does not seek this authority or Treasury Board does not grant it, the sponsoring minister must seek a distinct Treasury Board project approval and expenditure authority for each project that exceeds the approved departmental OPMC class in keeping with the requirements set out in the *Policy on the Planning and Management of Investments* and the *Directive on the Management of Projects and Programmes*.

### F.7 Associated authorities

* F.7.1In cases where programmes involve real property transactions or procurement activities that also require Treasury Board approval, departments are encouraged, where appropriate, to coordinate all required approvals (programme, real property and procurement) to provide a consolidated view to Treasury Board ministers.
