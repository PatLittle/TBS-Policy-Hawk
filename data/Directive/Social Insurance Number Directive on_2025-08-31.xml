This is because the SIN was the identifier used before the conversion to an employee identifying number or military service number was made. Also, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is authorized to use the SIN for file retrieval and enquiries associated with the Rural and Native and Housing program, which was terminated in 1993. The Canadian Government Annuities Program is authorized to use the SIN in the administration of their program. Other government institutions may have similar requirements; however, the use of the SIN would be limited to historical file retrieval only.</p></section><section><h4>Lawful investigation and SIN collection and use</h4><p>Entities are to limit their collection of the SIN to specific circumstances when the SIN is relevant and directly related to investigative activities or when it is collected or provided as part of the evidence gathering process.
