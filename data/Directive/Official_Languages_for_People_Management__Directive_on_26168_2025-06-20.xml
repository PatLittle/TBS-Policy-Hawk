          <h3>Part II â Linguistic Profile</h3>
        </header>
        <p>If a position is identified bilingual, managers establish a linguistic profile. The linguistic profile reflects the level of proficiency required to perform the duties and functions of the position in the second official language.</p>
        <p>
          Institutions listed at schedules I or IV of the FAA apply the 
          <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/staffing/qualification-standards/relation-official-languages.html">Qualification Standards in Relation to Official Languages</a>
           (Qualification Standards) when establishing the linguistic profile. 
        </p>
        <p>The linguistic profiles of bilingual positions involving service to the public or to employees are identified, at a minimum, at the intermediate level, or BBB for institutions applying the Qualification Standards.</p>
        <p>The linguistic profiles of bilingual positions involving the supervision of employees who occupy positions in bilingual regions are identified, at a minimum, at the superior level, or CBC for institutions applying the Qualification Standards.</p>
        <p>The above refers to minimum requirements and a higher level of proficiency in the second official language may be required in a given position depending on its duties, in accordance with section 91 of the OLA.</p>
        <p>Linguistic profiles of bilingual positions involving the supervision of employees who occupy positions in bilingual regions that were established at an intermediate level prior to June 20, 2025, will be raised to a superior level only when the position becomes vacant or is filled by a new appointment.</p>

          (Assistant Deputy Minister level) Throughout Canada, positions at the assistant deputy minister level or 
          <a href="#eqv">equivalent</a>
           are designated bilingual requiring a superior level of proficiency in the second official language. A superior level for institutions listed in schedules I or IV of the

           is CBC.
        </p>
        <p>(Other executive positions) Other executive positions are designated bilingual requiring a superior level of proficiency in the second official language so that incumbents in bilingual regions can carry out their duties and fulfil their obligation to create a workplace that is conducive to the use of English and French, if the position includes one or more of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the supervision of employees who occupy positions in bilingual regions;</li>
          <li>participation as a regular member in the institutionâs management team;</li>
          <li>significant role in exercising the institution's authority to direct, or to provide services to, other institutions;</li>
          <li>significant functions related to representing the institution to the public or employees of the institution;</li>
          <li>a significant role in the co-ordination of programs or activities of employees in bilingual regions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A superior level for institutions listed in schedules I or IV of the

      <p>Deputy heads or their delegates are responsible for ensuring the following:</p>
      <p>
        (Executives) 
        <a href="#imprs">Imperative staffing</a>
         is obligatory in the following circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Throughout Canada for assistant deputy minister level or 
          <a href="#eqv">equivalent</a>
           positions
        </li>
        <li>In bilingual regions, for all EX-02 to EX-05 positions</li>
        <li>In unilingual regions, for all EX-02 to EX-05 positions that include supervision of employees who occupy positions in bilingual regions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>(Persons with disabilities) When administrative measures can be put in place, imperative staffing is not mandatory for EX-02 to EX-05 positions or their equivalent when a candidate has received an exclusion for a medical reason confirming a long-term or recurring physical, mental or learning impairment that prevents them from attaining, through language training, including with accommodation, the required second official language proficiency. Measures must be taken to ensure the language requirements of the position are fulfilled.</p>
      <p>
        (External appointments) Imperative staffing is not mandatory in the case of external appointment processes ("open to the public") for indeterminate positions. Such appointments may be made either imperatively or 
        <a href="#nimprs">non-imperatively</a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>(Justification) Managers staffing bilingual positions non-imperatively provide the reasons and a justification in writing.They explain the measures taken to ensure that the positionâs bilingual functions are carried out until such time as the incumbent meets the positionâs language requirements.</p>
      <p>
        (Non-imperative Staffing) The provisions of the 
        <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-2005-118/index.html">Public Service Official Languages Exclusion Approval Order</a>
         as well as the 
        <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2005-347/index.html">Public Service Official Languages Appointment Regulations</a>
         are applied when a non-imperative staffing process is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Reclassification) The language requirements of a position are reviewed when it is reclassified. Reclassifications are considered appointments and are subject to the 
        <abbr title="Public Service Employment Act">PSEA</abbr>
        .
      </p>
      <p>(Modifications of language requirements or linguistic profiles) Whenever the language requirements or the linguistic profile of a position are modified, the incumbent is informed in writing within ten working days following the date of the modification. If the incumbent does not meet the positionâs new language requirements or its linguistic profile, the incumbent may remain in the position without having to meet the new requirements or the linguistic profile. If the position becomes bilingual or its linguistic profile is raised, the institution provides language training to the employee. The employee is strongly encouraged to take the training. The institution must take administrative measures to have the functions of the position carried out in both official languages.</p>
      <p>
        The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply in the case of the selection of employees for retention pursuant to section 22 of the 
        <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2005-334/index.html">Public Service Employment Regulations</a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        (Non-imperative Deployments) Deputy heads or their delegates are responsible for managing non-imperative deployments. The same provisions governing a non-imperative appointment are applied to deployments. The employee has to meet the language requirements of the position within the exclusion period, even if he or she is 
        <a href="#dply">deployed on a non-imperative basis</a>
         to another bilingual position with the same or lower linguistic profile. If the employee is deployed to a position with a higher linguistic profile, a new exclusion period begins on the date of the deployment.

    <appendix anchor="C" title="Appendix 3: Recruitment Measures">
      <p>Some possible recruitment measures are the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>extending the area of selection in order to include candidates from both official language groups;</li>
        <li>adopting a recruitment strategy for an official language group when it may improve its participation in the staffing process; and</li>
        <li>ensuring the linguistic composition of the assessment committee reflects the range of candidates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Certain practices are not acceptable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>setting or implementing quotas (numerical objectives or targets) for the number of Anglophones or Francophones, or both, to be appointed to a given number of positions over a given time period.</li>
        <li>arbitrarily defining positions' language requirements to encourage the recruitment of members of a single official language group.</li>
