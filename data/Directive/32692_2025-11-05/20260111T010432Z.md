For the purposes of Appendix A: Contracting Approvals, the term “competitive” includes the publishing of an advance contract award notice.

The contracting limits outlined in the subsections below do not confer a legal authority to contract.

All references to Public Services and Procurement Canada in this Appendix include the Defence Investment Agency.

Contracting authority is subject to ministerial delegation and, except for delegations provided by common service providers, may not be delegated between ministers.

When an exceptional limit is lower than the basic limit for its corresponding schedule, the exceptional limit applies.

Thresholds for contracting in the [*Government Contracts Regulations*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/) and in trade agreements must be adhered to, where applicable.

## Appendix E: Mandatory Procedures for Contracts Awarded to Indigenous Businesses

The Government of Canada is committed to economic reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and will contribute to improved socio-economic outcomes by increasing opportunities for First Nations, Inuit and Métis businesses through the federal procurement process.

These mandatory procedures describe:

* procedures to address the Government of Canada’s [commitment](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-services-procurement/news/2021/08/government-of-canada-announces-federal-wide-measures-to-increase-opportunities-for-indigenous-businesses.html) that a mandatory minimum target of 5% of the total value of contracts is awarded to Indigenous businesses (“5% target”) annually;
* procedures for:
  + public disclosure of contracts awarded to Indigenous businesses,
  + reporting on procurement planning and performance against the 5% target

Requirements for verifying Indigenous businesses for the purposes of these procedures are available from Indigenous Services Canada: Mandatory minimum 5% Indigenous procurement target (sac-isc.gc.ca).

This commitment also supports the requirements set out in subsection 4.1.3.6 of the Treasury Board [*Policy on the Planning and Management of Investments*](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32593) to uphold the obligations of the Crown with respect to Indigenous peoples. These obligations include Canada’s procurement obligations arising from multiple comprehensive land claims agreements (CLCAs). In the event of a conflict between a requirement in these mandatory procedures and a legal obligation, including an obligation under a CLCA, the legal obligation will apply.

These procedures should also be read in conjunction with the Treasury Board *Directive on Government Contracts, Including Real Property Leases, in the Nunavut Settlement Area*. In the event of a conflict between a requirement in these mandatory procedures and a requirement in the *Directive on Government Contracts, Including Real Property Leases, in the Nunavut Settlement Area* , the requirement in the directive will apply.

Departments are to meet or exceed the 5% target no later than the fiscal year-end of 2024–25, as set out in the schedule prescribed by Indigenous Services Canada for when departments are required to meet the 5% target. This schedule is based on an assessment of departments’ levels of readiness to meet the 5% target using prior departmental procurement plans related to the *Procurement Strategy for Indigenous Business*.
