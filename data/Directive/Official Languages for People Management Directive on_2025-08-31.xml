Reclassifications are considered appointments and are subject to the <abbr title="Public Service Employment Act">PSEA</abbr>.</p><p>(Modifications of language requirements or linguistic profiles) Whenever the language requirements or the linguistic profile of a position are modified, the incumbent is informed in writing within ten working days following the date of the modification. If the incumbent does not meet the position’s new language requirements or its linguistic profile, the incumbent may remain in the position without having to meet the new requirements or the linguistic profile. If the position becomes bilingual or its linguistic profile is raised, the institution provides language training to the employee. The employee is strongly encouraged to take the training. The institution must take administrative measures to have the functions of the position carried out in both official languages.</p><p>The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply in the case of the selection of employees for retention pursuant to section 22 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2005-334/index.html">Public Service Employment Regulations</a>.</p><p>(Non-imperative Deployments) Deputy heads or their delegates are responsible for managing non-imperative deployments.
