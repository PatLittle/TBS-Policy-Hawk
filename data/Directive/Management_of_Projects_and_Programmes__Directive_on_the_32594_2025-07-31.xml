    <p>Appendices F, G and H set out the authorities that are required from Treasury Board with respect to managing a programme. The content of the appendices has been developed based on international best practices and in consultation with pathfinder programmes in the Government of Canada context. Given that programme management is new to the Government of Canada, these appendices are a first iteration and may be revised to incorporate lessons from the management of different types of programmes across the government.</p>

      <p>In exercising oversight, the Treasury Board limits the expenditure authority exercised by ministers in the approval of projects.</p>
      <p>All departments and agencies subject to this directive have a base project approval authority limit of $2.5 million (inclusive of the Goods and Services Tax and the Harmonized Sales Tax).</p>
      <p>
        The basis for determining the  capacity to manage projects, and seeking an increase to this base amount, is  provided in the 
        <em>Mandatory Procedures  for Organizational Project Management Capacity</em>
        . Once approved by Treasury Board,  the Organizational Project Management Capacity Class establishes a ministerâs  project approval authority limit.
      </p>
      <p>Departments without an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class or an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 0 are to seek the approval of Treasury Board for all projects over $2.5 million (inclusive of the Goods and Services Tax and the Harmonized Sales Tax).</p>
      <p>For departments with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 1 or higher, the basis for the determination of the appropriate approval authority is the relationship between the approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of the department and the assessed Project Complexity and Risk Level of the project. Treasury Board may require any project to be brought forward for their consideration and approval.</p>
      <p>The threshold for completing a PCRA is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$2.5 million for departments without an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class or with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 0,</li>
        <li>$5 million for departments with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 1,</li>
        <li>$10 million for departments with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 2,</li>
        <li>$25 million for departments with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 3, and</li>
        <li>$50 million for departments with an approved Organizational Project Management Capacity Class of 4.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The results of the PCRA will confirm the approval authority and inform the planning, resourcing, governance and management of the project.</p>
