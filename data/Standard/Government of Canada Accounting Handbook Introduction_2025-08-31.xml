Objective</h2><div class="pol-content"><ol><li>The Government of Canada Accounting Handbook (GCAH) provides supplementary information that:
			
					<ul><li>States the Government’s accounting choices, where options exist, under Public Sector Accounting Standards (PSAS);</li><li>Provides the Government’s accounting policies in the absence of specific PSAS; or,</li><li>Provides specific policies relevant to departmental financial statements or quarterly financial reports.</li></ul></li></ol></div></section><section class="pol-sec"><h2 id="chaB">B. Context</h2><div class="pol-content"><ol start="2"><li>The Government of Canada uses financial information as a strategic business resource to support decision-making and management activities, policy development, program and service delivery and evidential needs, as well as for historical purposes and as an accountability mechanism.</li><li>Parliament and Canadians expect the Government of Canada to be well managed, which includes reporting of financial and related non-financial information that is fairly presented in all material respects. Such information is expected to be relevant, reliable, comparable, understandable and clearly presented in a manner that maximizes its usefulness to those for whom the financial information is prepared. In addition, there is an expectation of transparency and accountability regarding how the government spends public funds to achieve results for Canadians.</li><li>Government financial statements need to report the information required by users to help them make assessments and judgments concerning government financial operations and management (PS 1000.18). The information needed to aid understanding and assessments of government financial operations and to promote accountability extends beyond reporting surpluses and deficits. A government’s financial statements must provide information that describes liabilities and financial assets, its non-financial assets that are available for use in providing future services, the cost of using its economic resources in the delivery of services, as well as information about investing and financing activities and potential assets and liabilities (PS 1000.21). Standards are the concepts, conventions and postulates that provide principles to measure, recognize, present and disclose the financial information considered necessary for accountability and useful for decision making (PS 1000.05)</li><li>The Government of Canada’s accounting policies for the government’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Departmental Financial Statements are based on Canadian Public Sector Accounting Standards and Public Sector Guidelines (collectively, “PSAS”)). To ensure that the government and its component entities apply the appropriate accounting standards in a consistent manner, the GCAH, which has been issued by the Office of the Comptroller General of Canada, provides additional direction to supplement and support the application of PSAS. Along with PSAS, these parameters outline how transactions and other events are to be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in government financial statements.</li></ol></div></section><section class="pol-sec"><h2 id="chaC">C. Limitations</h2><div class="pol-content"><ol start="6"><li>These standards are not intended to apply to immaterial or insignificant items or matters. Furthermore, in developing these standards, no rule of general application can be phrased to suit all circumstances or combinations of circumstances that may arise, nor is there any substitute for the exercise of professional judgment in the determination of what constitutes fair presentation or good practice in a particular case (Introduction to public sector accounting standard, .26-.27).</li><li>The establishment of the Public Sector Accounting Handbook (PSAH) by the Public Sector Accounting Board is an evolutionary process which responds to changing information needs. As a result, the OCG will assess proposed changes to the PSAH on an ongoing basis and will determine whether the Directive on Accounting Standards or the GCAH require amendments.</li></ol></div></section><section class="pol-sec"><h2 id="chaD">D. Applicability of Canadian Public Sector Accounting Handbook (PSAH)</h2><div class="pol-content"><ol start="8"><li>Section F. Summary of Applicability of PSAS provides details on which PSAS are supported or supplemented by the GCAH. Where a policy choice, requirement, interpretation or other further direction has been issued to supplement PSAS, a listing of the additional direction available is provided. A list of PSAS is shown, together with a record of whether the standard:
