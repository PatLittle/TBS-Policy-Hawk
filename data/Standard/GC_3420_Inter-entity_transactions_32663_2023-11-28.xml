These inter-entity transactions can be in the form of either services provided by or to related parties or transfers of assets and liabilities from or to related parties.

                      <ol class="lst-lwr-alph"><li>Services provided on a without-charge basis by one department to all other government departments (e.g. Receiver General functions) are considered unallocated costs. This also includes most of the mandatory services. Mandatory services are defined either in a policy or in legislation such as the audit services provided by the Office of the Auditor General. Central        agency functions and mandatory services and programs are not normally provided on a recovery basis. No expense should be recorded by the receiving department and no revenue should be recorded by the providing department (PS 3420.11-13 ).</li><li>Certain services are provided by one department to other government departments either on a recovery basis or on a without charge basis. Examples of services provided  on both a without-charge basis and a recovery basis are legal services provided by the Department of Justice, and accommodation services provided by Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC). These services are accounted for as follows (PS 3420.11-13 ):
                              <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn"><li>Those provided on a recovery basis should be accounted for in the manner described in GC 3420.6.</li><li>Those provided on a without charge basis should be recorded for departmental financial statement purposes only and are not to be recorded in the CFMRS trial balance. The receiving department should record an expense at the carrying amount (i.e. estimated cost) of the service provided, with a corresponding credit at the bottom of the Statement of Operations and Departmental Net Financial Position. The providing department should not record a revenue for these services.</li></ol></li></ol><p>It is the department’s responsibility to review all material  services provided by or to related parties to determine the appropriate  accounting treatment and disclosure. At a minimum the services described  in 8 b.ii.  include:</p><ul><li>Accommodation services provided by PSPC;</li><li>Healthand dental coverage administered by the Treasury Board Secretariat;</li><li>Legal services provided by the Department of Justice; and</li><li>Workers’ compensation services provided by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC).</li></ul></li><li>Departments that provide  services on a without-charge basis, as described in GC 3420.8 b  should determine the carrying amount (i.e. estimated cost) of the service and  should communicate the information to the recipient departments in a timely  manner, along with sufficient supporting details, for the purposes of preparing  the annual financial statements.</li></ol></chapter><chapter anchor="H" title="Disclosure"><ol start="10"><li>Disclosure of inter-entity transactions is required as per PS 3420.23-.24.
