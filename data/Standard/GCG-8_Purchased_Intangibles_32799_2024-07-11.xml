      <ol start="2">
        <li>This guideline provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of purchased intangible assets.</li>
        <li>
          Purchased intangible assets include, but are not limited to:
    
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
            <li>intellectual property including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and plant-breeding rights (IPSASÂ 31.17);</li>
            <li>licences and permits, such as those for hunting and fishing;</li>
            <li>broadcasting rights or licences (IPSASÂ 31.42);</li>
            <li>airway route or landing rights (IPSASÂ 31.42);</li>
            <li>import quotas or licences (IPSASÂ 31.42);</li>
            <li>acquired lists of contacts, users, customers;</li>
            <li>scientific or technical knowledge;</li>
            <li>processes;</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Purchased intangible assets do not include:
    
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
            <li>software (accounted for under GCÂ 3150 Tangible Capital Assets);</li>
            <li>intangibles developed by the government or are otherwise in the research or development stage (including where the government pays for intangibles to be developed by third parties); and</li>
            <li>monetary items or financial instruments.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </chapter>
    <chapter anchor="E" title="Recognition">
      <ol start="5">
        <li>
          Further to PSG-8, purchased intangibles are recognized as assets when they: 
    
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
            <li>are purchased in an exchange transaction (i.e., involving consideration) from an armâs length third-party;</li>
            <li>meet the asset definition in PSÂ 1000 Financial Statement Concepts and PSÂ 3210 Assets, and the general recognition criteria in PSÂ 1000;</li>
            <li>are identifiable; and</li>
            <li>have a per-item cost of greater than $10,000 or as described in GCÂ 3150.02.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          A purchased intangible asset is identifiable if it either (IPSASÂ 31.19): 
    
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
            <li>is separable, i.e., it is capable of being separated or divided from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or together with a related contract, identifiable asset or liability, regardless of whether the entity intends to do so; or</li>
            <li>arises from binding arrangements (including rights from contract or other legal rights), regardless of whether those rights are transferrable or separable from the entity or from other rights and obligations.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </chapter>
    <chapter anchor="F" title="Measurement">
      <ol start="7">
        <li>Purchased intangible assets should be initially recognized at cost.</li>
        <li>Purchased intangible assets should be subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and less any impairment adjustments.</li>
      </ol>
    </chapter>
    <chapter anchor="G" title="Amortization">
      <ol start="9">
        <li>A purchased intangible asset should be amortized on a systematic basis over its useful life.</li>
        <li>Specifically, the cost less the residual value should be amortized over the purchased intangible assetâs useful life (IPSASÂ 31.96).</li>
        <li>
          Residual value for a purchased intangible asset should be assumed to be zero, unless there is either (IPSASÂ 31.99):
    
          <ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
            <li>a commitment by a third party to acquire the asset at the end of its useful life; or</li>
            <li>an active market for the purchased intangible and it is probable the market will exist at the end of the purchased intangibleâs useful life.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The amortization method should reflect the pattern in which the assetâs future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Where no pattern is evident, straight-line amortization may be used (IPSASÂ 31.99).</li>
      </ol>
    </chapter>
    <chapter anchor="H" title="Impairment">
      <ol start="13">
        <li>Once a purchased intangible is recognized as an asset, conditions should be monitored at each annual reporting date, at a minimum, for evidence that a write-down of the assetâs carrying value to its net realizable value is necessary.</li>
        <li>Conditions suggesting a write-down is required include where the purchased intangible asset no longer enables or contributes to the entityâs ability to provide future goods or services, achieve its mandate, generate future cash inflows or reduce future cash outflows.</li>
        <li>Similar to tangible capital assets, for a write-down of purchased intangible assets to occur, the condition(s) must be expected to be permanent, and the write-down should not be reversed.</li>
      </ol>
    </chapter>
    <chapter anchor="I" title="Departmental Financial Statements">
      <ol start="16">
        <li>Applies without additional policy choices or interpretation for Departmental Financial Statements.</li>
      </ol>

          <p>This figure illustrates some of the key questions that should be considered when determining if an item meets the definition of a purchased intangible asset.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Does the item acquired have physical substance? There is a footnote to this question noting that, where the item is contained in or on something of physical substance, such as a disk, document or prototype, judgment should be applied to assess whether the physical or intangible element is more significant. Reference is made to FAQÂ 5 for further information. 


              <ul>
                <li>If yes, the item is not a purchased intangible asset.</li>
                <li>If no, continue to the following question.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Was the item acquired in an armâs length exchange transaction? 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If no, was the item acquired from another entity in the Government of Canada reporting entity? 
                  <ul>
                    <li>If no, the item is not a purchased intangible asset.</li>
                    <li>
                      If yes, was the item initially recognized as a purchased intangible asset within the GC reporting entity in accordance with PSG-8? 
                      <ul>
                        <li>If yes, the item is a purchased intangible asset.</li>
                        <li>If no, the item is not a purchased intangible asset.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If yes, continue to the following question.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Is the item a monetary item (i.e., money or claim to a fixed amount of CAD or foreign money) or a financial instrument? 
              <ul>
                <li>If yes, the item is not a purchased intangible asset.</li>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Is the item software? 
              <ul>
                <li>If yes, the item is not a purchased intangible asset.</li>
                <li>If no, continue to the following question.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Is the item otherwise capitalizable as part of the acquisition of a tangible capital asset? 
              <ul>
                <li>If yes, the item is not a purchased intangible asset.</li>
                <li>If no, continue to the following question.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Is the intangible separable? 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If no, does the intangible arise from a binding arrangement (contractual or other legally enforceable rights)? 
                  <ul>
                    <li>If no, the item is not a purchased intangible asset.</li>
                    <li>If yes, continue to the following question.</li>
                  </ul>

                <li>If yes, continue to the following question.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Are there future economic benefits associated with the intangible? 
              <ul>
                <li>If no, the item is not a purchased intangible asset.</li>
                <li>
                  If yes, is access to the future economic benefits controlled by the entity? 
                  <ul>
                    <li>If no, the item is not a purchased intangible asset.</li>
                    <li>If yes, the item is a purchased intangible asset.</li>
