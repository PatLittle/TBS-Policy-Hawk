          The Government of Canada determines whether contamination  is above the environmental standard, in accordance with subsectionÂ 4.2.17 of the 
          <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32691">Directive on the Management of Real Property</a>
          . 
        </li>
        <li>If a liability is not being recorded because a reasonable estimate cannot be  made, future economic benefits are not expected to be given up,  or the government is not responsible or is not accepting responsibility, the  reason or reasons must be provided, by site, to the Office of the Comptroller  General.</li>
        <li>
          Further to PSÂ 3260.36-.39, if there is uncertainty  regarding the governmentâs responsibility, the government may have a contingent  liability. Refer to  
          <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32520">GCÂ 3300-3310 Contingent Liabilities and Loan  Guarantees</a>
           for the accounting treatment of contingent liabilities. All  contingent liabilities related to the costs to remediate a contaminated site  must be recorded in the FCSI.

          Remediation liabilities include:
    
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
            <li>Care, maintenance, and monitoring costs that are a part of the  remediation strategy and that are completed during the remediation phase;</li>
            <li>Final confirmatory sampling and the final report;</li>
            <li>Short-term (that is, two to five years) monitoring costs included in the remediation  strategy; and</li>
            <li>Risk management costs only if directly related to reducing,  removing, or containing the contaminant in order to prevent, minimize or  mitigate damage to human health or the environment.</li>

          Remediation liabilities exclude:  
    
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
            <li>Costs related to research and development of technologies (that is, bench-scale  testing or demonstration on a small scale at field sites) or a skill  development program;</li>
            <li>Costs relating to surveying areas in order to find archaeological sites,  excavating sites in order to recover cultural remains, and the subsequent  classification, analysis, and preservation of these sites; and</li>
            <li>Costs incurred once the site has been brought to a level that is  considered acceptable such as sampling, maintenance, and monitoring performed  after the site has been remediated and confirmed to be successfully remediated.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Costs in excess of the amount required to bring the site to the current  minimum standard should be classified as a betterment. Refer to 
          <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32518">GCÂ 3150  Tangible Capital Assets</a>
           for the accounting treatment of betterments.
        </li>
        <li>When the planned use of a site is expected to cause  contamination that must be cleaned-up on a regular basis, for example firing  ranges, these costs do not meet the definition of a remediation liability and  should be expensed. </li>

        <li>Further to PSÂ 3260.62, the accounting treatment of recoveries will  depend on the nature of the event. Further analysis should be done to determine  if the recoveries are related to an asset or a contingent asset.</li>
